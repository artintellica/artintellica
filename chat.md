i'm writing a series of blog posts about machine learning. you're helping me do it. right now, we're working on a series about linear algebra, specifically as it pertains to machine learning. attached is the outline. each blog post has math, python code, and examples. for python code, we demonstrate with either numpy/scipy or pytorch, or both, dependending on what is best for the cirumstances. there are always 6 exercises. can you please respond with the text for the 12th blog post on positive definite matrices?
