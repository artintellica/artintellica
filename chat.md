there is something wrong with this code. if the markdown contains front-matter, everything between the first two series of +++ should be regarded as front-matter. however, if there are anymore instances of the string +++ in the markdown, that should just be regarded as a string. where in this code is the mistake? basically, what's happening is that if there are more instances of the string +++, everything after that doesn't show at all.

```typescript
export const loader = async ({ request, params }: Route.LoaderArgs) => {
  const filename = params.filename;
  const newBlogPosts = blogPosts
    .map((post) => {
      return {
        title: post.title,
        date: post.date,
        author: post.author,
        filename: post.filename,
        code: post.code,
        content: "",
      };
    })
    .sort((a, b) => a.filename.localeCompare(b.filename))
    .reverse();

  const blogPost = newBlogPosts.find((post) => post.filename === `${filename}`);
  if (!blogPost) {
    throw new Response(null, { status: 404, statusText: "Not found" });
  }
  // load content from app/blog/filename
  const blogDir = path.join("docs", "blog");
  const filePath = path.join(blogDir, `${filename}`);
  const fileContent = fs
    .readFileSync(filePath, "utf8")
    .split("+++")[2] as string;
  blogPost.content = fileContent;

  // get five most recent blog posts before this one
  const recentBlogPosts = newBlogPosts
    .filter((post) => post.filename.localeCompare(filename) < 0)
    .slice(0, 5);

  const nextBlogPosts = newBlogPosts
    .filter((post) => post.filename.localeCompare(filename) > 0)
    .reverse()
    .slice(0, 5);

  return { blogPost, recentBlogPosts, nextBlogPosts };
};
```

Great question! The issue lies in **how you are parsing the front-matter** and extracting the content. Let's break it down:

---

### **What's wrong?**

You currently do:

```typescript
const fileContent = fs
  .readFileSync(filePath, "utf8")
  .split("+++")[2] as string;
```

#### **What does this do?**

- It splits the file by `+++`.
- It then takes **the third element** (`[2]`), which is everything after the **second occurrence** of `+++`.

---

### **Why doesn't this work as intended?**

If your markdown contains **more than 2** instances of `+++`, for example:

```
+++
title = "Hello"
+++
Here is some content.
More content.
+++
Even more content here.
```

`.split("+++")` on this file yields:

```js
[
  "",
  "\ntitle = \"Hello\"\n",
  "\nHere is some content.\nMore content.\n",
  "\nEven more content here.\n"
]
```

- **`.split("+++")[2]`** gives you only the part between the **second and third** `+++`, but if there is a fourth, fifth, etc., you *lose* content after any subsequent `+++`.

---

**Result:**  
Youâ€™re only getting the content that comes **immediately after the front-matter** but before any further `+++` separators.  
Everything after any further `+++` is never shown.

---

## **How do you fix it?**

You need to only treat the first pair of `+++` as front-matter delimiters; anything after that should be preserved as content.

### **Solution:**

Instead of splitting, use **`.indexOf`** to find the first two occurrences, and take everything after the second.

**Example fix:**

```typescript
const contentRaw = fs.readFileSync(filePath, "utf8");
const fmStart = contentRaw.indexOf('+++');
if (fmStart === -1) {
  // No frontmatter, use whole file as content
  blogPost.content = contentRaw;
} else {
  const fmEnd = contentRaw.indexOf('+++', fmStart + 3);
  if (fmEnd === -1) {
    // Only one +++, invalid front-matter, maybe handle as error or raw content
    blogPost.content = contentRaw;
  } else {
    // Content starts after the second +++
    blogPost.content = contentRaw.slice(fmEnd + 3);
  }
}
```

---

- This **removes only the front-matter block** (first two `+++`).
- Anything after, including further `+++` strings, will be preserved as markdown content.

---

### **Summary**

- **Problem:** `.split("+++")[2]` only gets content between the **second and third** `+++`, discarding everything after.
- **Fix:** Use `.indexOf` to extract everything after the closing front-matter delimiter, preserving further `+++` as part of the content.
