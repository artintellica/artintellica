Today I'm happy to introduce Artintellica, a new set of resurces for learning
AI.

Artintellica will include python code, CUDA code, typescript code, and math
resources for learning machine learning and AI.

I am creating Artintellica because I am learning AI myself, and it may be
helpful to make all of my resources available to the public as I go.

Artintellica is fully open-source, and you can find the code for the website and
all projects on GitHub at
[github.com/artintellica/artintellica](https://github.com/artintellica/artintellica).

**Note**: The new version of Artintellica has nothing to do with the previous
version launched in late 2023. If you were a user of that version, your AI
agents have been moved to [Hallucipedia](https://hallucipedia.com).
