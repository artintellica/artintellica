i'd like to make a series of blog posts to study "leet code" in typescript. leet
code, of course, concerns programming data structures and algorithms. the goal
of the series of blog posts is to start with elementary leet code examples and
work up towards more advanced examples. the leet code examples should all
pertain to the sort of things that are likely to be covered in job interviews in
silicon valley.

first, can you give me a list of 10 or so leet cod problems that are likely to
be used in job interviews, starting with more elementary problems and working up
towards more advanced problems? the problems should come in two flavors:
problems that are language-agnostic, and then problems specific to typescript.

I'm excited to help you create a series of blog posts to study LeetCode problems in TypeScript with a focus on job interviews in Silicon Valley. LeetCode is a fantastic resource for preparing for technical interviews, as many companies, especially in tech hubs like Silicon Valley, often use similar problems to test candidates' problem-solving skills, understanding of data structures, and algorithmic thinking.

I'll first provide a list of 10 LeetCode problems that are commonly encountered in job interviews, starting with elementary problems and progressing to more advanced ones. I'll split them into two categories as requested: **language-agnostic problems** (focused on data structures and algorithms that can be solved in any language) and **TypeScript-specific problems** (or problems where TypeScript's features can be highlighted or are particularly relevant, even if the problem itself isn't strictly TypeScript-only). Since LeetCode problems are generally language-agnostic, for the TypeScript-specific category, I'll choose problems where TypeScript's type system, interfaces, or other language features can add value to the explanation or solution.

I'll also include a brief description of each problem, its difficulty level (Easy, Medium, Hard), and why it's relevant for Silicon Valley interviews. These problems are selected based on their frequency in interviews (derived from community feedback, forums like Blind, and resources like "Cracking the Coding Interview") and their ability to test core concepts like arrays, strings, trees, graphs, and dynamic programming.

### TypeScript-Specific LeetCode Problems (or Problems Highlighting TypeScript Features)
Since LeetCode problems are generally language-agnostic, there aren't problems explicitly designed for TypeScript. However, I’ve selected problems where TypeScript’s type system, interfaces, or other features can be emphasized in the solution or explanation. These are still common interview problems, but I’ll note how TypeScript can be leveraged.

1. **Two Sum (Easy)**  
   - **Problem**: Same as above.
   - **TypeScript Focus**: Use TypeScript interfaces to define input and output types (e.g., `number[]` for input and a tuple for indices). Highlight type safety when accessing array elements.
   - **Why It's Relevant**: Same as above; TypeScript’s type annotations can make the code more maintainable and self-documenting, which is valued in team settings at Silicon Valley companies.

2. **Valid Parentheses (Easy)**  
   - **Problem**: Same as above.
   - **TypeScript Focus**: Use TypeScript to define a type for valid characters or use a `Map<string, string>` for matching brackets, showcasing type safety in data structures.
   - **Why It's Relevant**: Same as above; TypeScript’s type system can help catch errors early in development.

3. **Design Hit Counter (Medium)**  
   - **Problem**: Design a hit counter that counts the number of hits received in the last 5 minutes.
   - **TypeScript Focus**: Use classes with proper typing for timestamps and methods. Highlight how interfaces can define the contract for the HitCounter class.
   - **Why It's Relevant**: Design problems are common at companies like Google, and TypeScript’s OOP features can make the solution clearer.

4. **Group Anagrams (Medium)**  
   - **Problem**: Given an array of strings, group the anagrams together.
   - **TypeScript Focus**: Use a `Map<string, string[]>` with explicit typing to store sorted characters as keys and lists of anagrams as values. Discuss how TypeScript prevents type mismatches.
   - **Why It's Relevant**: Tests string manipulation and hash maps, often asked at Amazon and Meta.

5. **Implement Trie (Prefix Tree) (Medium)**  
   - **Problem**: Implement a trie with insert, search, and startsWith methods.
   - **TypeScript Focus**: Define a `TrieNode` interface with optional children and boolean flags for end-of-word. Showcase how TypeScript’s strict typing helps in debugging tree structures.
   - **Why It's Relevant**: Tries are a common data structure for autocomplete features, often tested at companies like Google and Microsoft.

# Mastering Hard LeetCode Problems: Finding the Median of Two Sorted Arrays in TypeScript

Welcome back to our LeetCode journey in TypeScript! In this post, we're diving into one of the more challenging problems often encountered in technical interviews at top-tier Silicon Valley companies like Google: **Median of Two Sorted Arrays**. This problem is classified as "Hard" on LeetCode, and it’s a fantastic test of your ability to handle binary search, arrays, and edge cases under pressure. Whether you're preparing for a final-round interview or just looking to sharpen your algorithmic skills, this problem will push your limits and teach you valuable techniques.

We'll break down the problem, explain it in simple terms, provide a detailed TypeScript solution, and analyze the approach step by step. Let's get started!

## Problem Introduction: Median of Two Sorted Arrays

The problem is straightforward to state but tricky to solve efficiently. You're given two sorted arrays of integers, `nums1` and `nums2`, of lengths `m` and `n` respectively. Your task is to find the median of the combined sorted array formed by merging these two arrays. The median is the middle value in a sorted list of numbers. If the total number of elements is odd, the median is the middle element. If it's even, the median is the average of the two middle elements.

For example:
- If `nums1 = [1, 3]` and `nums2 = [2]`, the combined sorted array is `[1, 2, 3]`, and the median is `2`.
- If `nums1 = [1, 2]` and `nums2 = [3, 4]`, the combined sorted array is `[1, 2, 3, 4]`, and the median is `(2 + 3) / 2 = 2.5`.

The challenge lies in solving this efficiently without merging the arrays explicitly, as that would take $O(m + n)$ time and space. Instead, we aim for a solution with $O(\log(\min(m, n)))$ time complexity using binary search.

**Why It's Relevant**: This problem is a favorite in final interview rounds because it tests deep understanding of binary search, partitioning arrays, and handling edge cases. It’s not just about coding; it’s about thinking creatively under constraints.

## ELI5: Understanding the Median of Two Sorted Arrays

Imagine you have two sorted lists of numbers, like two stacks of cards already in order. One stack has numbers like 1, 3, and the other has 2, 4, 6. You want to find the "middle" number if you combined both stacks into one big sorted stack. But here’s the catch: you don’t want to actually combine them because that takes too long. Instead, you want to figure out the middle by just looking at parts of each stack.

Think of it like cutting each stack into two parts. You guess where to cut the first stack so that the left part has some numbers, and the right part has the rest. Then, you cut the second stack so that the left parts of both stacks together have about half the total cards. If the numbers at the edges of your cuts make sense (the biggest number on the left is smaller than the smallest number on the right for both cuts), you’ve found the right spot! The median is then based on those edge numbers.

This "cutting" idea is what binary search helps us do. We keep guessing where to cut until we find the perfect spot, and we do it fast by halving our search space each time.

## Approach to Solving the Problem

To solve this problem efficiently, we use a binary search approach to partition the two arrays into two halves such that the left halves of both arrays contain elements less than or equal to the right halves. Here's the high-level idea:

1. **Partitioning**: We try to partition `nums1` and `nums2` into left and right parts. For `nums1`, pick a partition point `x`, so the left part is `nums1[0..x-1]` and the right part is `nums1[x..m-1]`. Similarly, for `nums2`, pick a partition point `y`, so the left part is `nums2[0..y-1]` and the right part is `nums2[y..n-1]`.
2. **Balance**: Ensure the number of elements in the combined left parts equals (or is one less than) the number in the combined right parts. This means `x + y` should be roughly half of `m + n`.
3. **Validity Check**: Check if the partition is valid by ensuring the largest element in the left parts is less than or equal to the smallest element in the right parts. Mathematically, `nums1[x-1] <= nums2[y]` and `nums2[y-1] <= nums1[x]`.
4. **Binary Search**: Use binary search on the smaller array to find the correct partition point `x`, then compute `y` as `((m + n + 1) / 2) - x`. Adjust the search range based on whether the partition is valid.
5. **Median Calculation**: Once the correct partition is found, compute the median based on whether the total length is odd or even.

The time complexity is $O(\log(\min(m, n)))$ because we perform binary search on the smaller array. Space complexity is $O(1)$ as we use only a few variables.

## TypeScript Solution: Median of Two Sorted Arrays

Below is the complete TypeScript solution to the problem. I've added detailed comments to explain each step. We'll assume the input arrays are `number[]` types for clarity and type safety.

```typescript
function findMedianSortedArrays(nums1: number[], nums2: number[]): number {
    // Ensure nums1 is the shorter array for efficiency in binary search
    if (nums1.length > nums2.length) {
        [nums1, nums2] = [nums2, nums1];
    }
    
    const m: number = nums1.length;
    const n: number = nums2.length;
    let left: number = 0;
    let right: number = m;
    
    while (left <= right) {
        // Partition points for nums1 and nums2
        const x: number = Math.floor((left + right) / 2);
        const y: number = Math.floor((m + n + 1) / 2) - x;
        
        // Get left and right values for nums1
        const left1: number = x === 0 ? Number.NEGATIVE_INFINITY : nums1[x - 1];
        const right1: number = x === m ? Number.POSITIVE_INFINITY : nums1[x];
        
        // Get left and right values for nums2
        const left2: number = y === 0 ? Number.NEGATIVE_INFINITY : nums2[y - 1];
        const right2: number = y === n ? Number.POSITIVE_INFINITY : nums2[y];
        
        // Check if partition is valid
        if (left1 <= right2 && left2 <= right1) {
            // If total length is odd, median is the max of left parts
            if ((m + n) % 2 === 1) {
                return Math.max(left1, left2);
            } else {
                // If total length is even, median is average of max(left) and min(right)
                return (Math.max(left1, left2) + Math.min(right1, right2)) / 2;
            }
        } else if (left1 > right2) {
            // If left1 is too big, move partition left in nums1
            right = x - 1;
        } else {
            // If left2 is too big, move partition right in nums1
            left = x + 1;
        }
    }
    
    throw new Error("Input arrays are not sorted");
}
```

## Explanation of the Code

- **Swapping Arrays**: We ensure `nums1` is the shorter array by swapping if necessary. This optimizes the binary search by minimizing iterations.
- **Binary Search Setup**: We search for the partition point `x` in `nums1` between `0` and `m`. For each `x`, we compute `y` to balance the left and right halves.
- **Edge Cases with Infinity**: If a partition point is at the start or end of an array, we use `Number.NEGATIVE_INFINITY` or `Number.POSITIVE_INFINITY` to handle comparisons safely.
- **Partition Validation**: We check if `left1 <= right2` and `left2 <= right1`. If true, we’ve found the correct partition and compute the median.
- **Median Calculation**: For odd total length, the median is the maximum of the left parts. For even length, it’s the average of the maximum of left parts and minimum of right parts.
- **Adjustment**: If the partition isn’t valid, we adjust the binary search range based on which side needs correction.

## Testing the Solution

Let’s test the solution with a few examples to verify it works correctly.

**Example 1**:
```typescript
const nums1: number[] = [1, 3];
const nums2: number[] = [2];
console.log(findMedianSortedArrays(nums1, nums2)); // Output: 2
```
- Combined sorted array: `[1, 2, 3]`
- Median: `2` (middle element since total length is 3, odd)

**Example 2**:
```typescript
const nums1: number[] = [1, 2];
const nums2: number[] = [3, 4];
console.log(findMedianSortedArrays(nums1, nums2)); // Output: 2.5
```
- Combined sorted array: `[1, 2, 3, 4]`
- Median: `(2 + 3) / 2 = 2.5` (average of two middle elements since total length is 4, even)

**Example 3**:
```typescript
const nums1: number[] = [0, 0];
const nums2: number[] = [0, 0];
console.log(findMedianSortedArrays(nums1, nums2)); // Output: 0
```
- Combined sorted array: `[0, 0, 0, 0]`
- Median: `(0 + 0) / 2 = 0`

## Key Takeaways and Interview Tips

When discussing this problem in an interview:
- Explain the binary search approach clearly, focusing on why merging arrays ($O(m + n)$) is inefficient compared to partitioning ($O(\log(\min(m, n)))$).
- Draw diagrams to show how partitions work, especially for edge cases like empty arrays or arrays of different sizes.
- Mention how you handle edge cases with infinities to avoid index out-of-bounds errors.
- Be prepared to discuss why you chose the shorter array for binary search (to minimize iterations).

## Conclusion

In this blog post, we tackled the challenging LeetCode problem "Median of Two Sorted Arrays" using TypeScript. We explored a binary search-based solution that achieves $O(\log(\min(m, n)))$ time complexity by partitioning the arrays instead of merging them. Through an ELI5 explanation, we likened the problem to cutting stacks of cards to find the middle without combining them. The TypeScript code provided a robust, type-safe implementation with detailed comments and test cases to solidify understanding.

Key points to remember:
- Binary search on the smaller array optimizes the solution.
- Proper partitioning ensures left elements are less than or equal to right elements across both arrays.
- Edge cases are handled using infinities to avoid errors.
- This problem tests advanced algorithmic thinking, making it a staple in final-round interviews at companies like Google.
