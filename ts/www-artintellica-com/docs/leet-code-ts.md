i'd like to make a series of blog posts to study "leet code" in typescript. leet
code, of course, concerns programming data structures and algorithms. the goal
of the series of blog posts is to start with elementary leet code examples and
work up towards more advanced examples. the leet code examples should all
pertain to the sort of things that are likely to be covered in job interviews in
silicon valley.

first, can you give me a list of 10 or so leet cod problems that are likely to
be used in job interviews, starting with more elementary problems and working up
towards more advanced problems? the problems should come in two flavors:
problems that are language-agnostic, and then problems specific to typescript.

# === ASSISTANT ===

I'm excited to help you create a series of blog posts to study LeetCode problems in TypeScript with a focus on job interviews in Silicon Valley. LeetCode is a fantastic resource for preparing for technical interviews, as many companies, especially in tech hubs like Silicon Valley, often use similar problems to test candidates' problem-solving skills, understanding of data structures, and algorithmic thinking.

I'll first provide a list of 10 LeetCode problems that are commonly encountered in job interviews, starting with elementary problems and progressing to more advanced ones. I'll split them into two categories as requested: **language-agnostic problems** (focused on data structures and algorithms that can be solved in any language) and **TypeScript-specific problems** (or problems where TypeScript's features can be highlighted or are particularly relevant, even if the problem itself isn't strictly TypeScript-only). Since LeetCode problems are generally language-agnostic, for the TypeScript-specific category, I'll choose problems where TypeScript's type system, interfaces, or other language features can add value to the explanation or solution.

I'll also include a brief description of each problem, its difficulty level (Easy, Medium, Hard), and why it's relevant for Silicon Valley interviews. These problems are selected based on their frequency in interviews (derived from community feedback, forums like Blind, and resources like "Cracking the Coding Interview") and their ability to test core concepts like arrays, strings, trees, graphs, and dynamic programming.

### TypeScript-Specific LeetCode Problems (or Problems Highlighting TypeScript Features)
Since LeetCode problems are generally language-agnostic, there aren't problems explicitly designed for TypeScript. However, I’ve selected problems where TypeScript’s type system, interfaces, or other features can be emphasized in the solution or explanation. These are still common interview problems, but I’ll note how TypeScript can be leveraged.

1. **Two Sum (Easy)**  
   - **Problem**: Same as above.
   - **TypeScript Focus**: Use TypeScript interfaces to define input and output types (e.g., `number[]` for input and a tuple for indices). Highlight type safety when accessing array elements.
   - **Why It's Relevant**: Same as above; TypeScript’s type annotations can make the code more maintainable and self-documenting, which is valued in team settings at Silicon Valley companies.

2. **Valid Parentheses (Easy)**  
   - **Problem**: Same as above.
   - **TypeScript Focus**: Use TypeScript to define a type for valid characters or use a `Map<string, string>` for matching brackets, showcasing type safety in data structures.
   - **Why It's Relevant**: Same as above; TypeScript’s type system can help catch errors early in development.

3. **Design Hit Counter (Medium)**  
   - **Problem**: Design a hit counter that counts the number of hits received in the last 5 minutes.
   - **TypeScript Focus**: Use classes with proper typing for timestamps and methods. Highlight how interfaces can define the contract for the HitCounter class.
   - **Why It's Relevant**: Design problems are common at companies like Google, and TypeScript’s OOP features can make the solution clearer.

4. **Group Anagrams (Medium)**  
   - **Problem**: Given an array of strings, group the anagrams together.
   - **TypeScript Focus**: Use a `Map<string, string[]>` with explicit typing to store sorted characters as keys and lists of anagrams as values. Discuss how TypeScript prevents type mismatches.
   - **Why It's Relevant**: Tests string manipulation and hash maps, often asked at Amazon and Meta.

5. **Implement Trie (Prefix Tree) (Medium)**  
   - **Problem**: Implement a trie with insert, search, and startsWith methods.
   - **TypeScript Focus**: Define a `TrieNode` interface with optional children and boolean flags for end-of-word. Showcase how TypeScript’s strict typing helps in debugging tree structures.
   - **Why It's Relevant**: Tries are a common data structure for autocomplete features, often tested at companies like Google and Microsoft.

# Word Break Problem: Mastering Dynamic Programming in TypeScript

Welcome back to our LeetCode journey with TypeScript! In this blog post, we're diving into a classic medium-difficulty problem: **Word Break**. This problem is a fantastic way to explore dynamic programming (DP), a critical concept for technical interviews, especially at top-tier companies like Google and Meta. If you're preparing for a Silicon Valley job interview, understanding how to tackle problems like this can set you apart. We'll break down the problem, explain it in simple terms, and provide a complete TypeScript solution with detailed commentary. Let's get started!

## Introduction to the Word Break Problem

The Word Break problem is defined as follows: Given a string `s` and a dictionary of words `wordDict`, determine if `s` can be segmented into a space-separated sequence of one or more dictionary words. In other words, can you break the string into pieces where each piece is a valid word from the dictionary?

For example:
- If `s = "leetcode"` and `wordDict = ["leet", "code"]`, the answer is `true` because "leetcode" can be split into "leet" and "code".
- If `s = "applepenapple"` and `wordDict = ["apple", "pen"]`, the answer is `true` because it can be split into "apple", "pen", and "apple".
- If `s = "catsandog"` and `wordDict = ["cats", "dog", "sand", "and", "cat"]`, the answer is `false` because there's no way to split it into valid words from the dictionary.

This problem tests your ability to use dynamic programming to solve a string segmentation challenge. Dynamic programming is a technique where you break a complex problem into smaller subproblems and store their results to avoid redundant computations. It's a staple in coding interviews because it often appears in problems involving optimization or decision-making, like this one.

## ELI5: Explaining Word Break Like You're Five

Imagine you have a long word, like "icecream", and a little book of smaller words, like ["ice", "cream"]. Your job is to see if you can cut the long word into pieces that are all in your book. So, can you cut "icecream" into "ice" and "cream"? Yes, because both pieces are in the book!

Now, think of checking every possible way to cut the word. Start from the beginning: Can I cut off the first letter? The first two letters? And so on. For each cut, check if that piece is in your book. If it is, then check if the rest of the word can also be cut into pieces from the book. To make this faster, you remember (or write down) which parts you've already figured out, so you don't have to check them again. This "remembering" trick is what we call dynamic programming!

In the end, if you can cut the whole word into pieces that are all in the book, you say "Yes, it works!" Otherwise, you say "No, it doesn't."

## Solving Word Break with Dynamic Programming in TypeScript

Let's solve this problem using dynamic programming. The idea is to create a boolean array `dp` where `dp[i]` represents whether the substring `s[0...i-1]` can be segmented into words from the dictionary. We'll build this array step by step.

### Approach
1. Create a DP array of size `s.length + 1`, initialized to `false`. The extra slot is for the empty string, which is always valid (`dp[0] = true`).
2. For each position `i` in the string (from 1 to `s.length`), check every possible substring ending at `i` by looking at previous positions `j` (from 0 to `i-1`).
3. If `dp[j]` is `true` (meaning `s[0...j-1]` is valid) and the substring `s[j...i-1]` is in the dictionary, then set `dp[i] = true`.
4. Finally, `dp[s.length]` tells us if the entire string can be segmented.

This approach ensures we check all possible ways to split the string while reusing results from smaller subproblems, making it efficient with a time complexity of $O(n^2)$, where $n$ is the length of the string.

### TypeScript Solution

Below is the complete TypeScript solution with detailed comments explaining each step:

```typescript
function wordBreak(s: string, wordDict: string[]): boolean {
    // Convert wordDict to a Set for O(1) lookup time
    const wordSet = new Set<string>(wordDict);
    
    // Create a DP array where dp[i] means s[0...i-1] can be segmented
    const dp: boolean[] = new Array(s.length + 1).fill(false);
    
    // Empty string is always valid
    dp[0] = true;
    
    // Iterate through each position i in the string
    for (let i = 1; i <= s.length; i++) {
        // Check every possible substring ending at i by looking at previous positions j
        for (let j = 0; j < i; j++) {
            // If s[0...j-1] is valid and s[j...i-1] is in the dictionary
            if (dp[j] && wordSet.has(s.substring(j, i))) {
                dp[i] = true;
                break; // No need to check further once we find a valid split
            }
        }
    }
    
    // Return whether the entire string can be segmented
    return dp[s.length];
}

// Test cases to demonstrate the solution
function runTests(): void {
    console.log("Test 1:", wordBreak("leetcode", ["leet", "code"])); // Expected: true
    console.log("Test 2:", wordBreak("applepenapple", ["apple", "pen"])); // Expected: true
    console.log("Test 3:", wordBreak("catsandog", ["cats", "dog", "sand", "and", "cat"])); // Expected: false
}

// Run the tests
runTests();
```

### Explanation of the Code
- **Type Safety**: We're using TypeScript's type annotations (`string` and `string[]`) to ensure the input types are correct. The `Set<string>` ensures type-safe dictionary lookups.
- **DP Array**: The `dp` array is typed as `boolean[]` for clarity. It stores whether each prefix of the string is valid.
- **Efficiency**: Using a `Set` for `wordDict` makes lookups $O(1)$, which is crucial since we do many lookups. The overall time complexity is $O(n^2)$, and space complexity is $O(n)$.
- **Test Cases**: I've included test cases to verify the solution works as expected. You can run this code in a TypeScript environment (e.g., with `ts-node`) to see the output.

### Output of Test Cases
When you run the code, you'll get:
```
Test 1: true
Test 2: true
Test 3: false
```
These results match the expected behavior: "leetcode" and "applepenapple" can be segmented, but "catsandog" cannot.

## Additional Exercise: Word Break with Word List Output

As a bonus, let's extend the problem to not just return whether the string can be segmented, but also return one possible segmentation (i.e., the list of words). This is a common follow-up question in interviews to test if you can adapt your solution.

### Approach for Word List Output
We'll modify the DP solution to track the words used in the segmentation. Instead of just storing a boolean in `dp`, we'll store the list of words (or an empty array if invalid) that form the segmentation up to that point.

### TypeScript Solution for Word List Output

```typescript
function wordBreakWithList(s: string, wordDict: string[]): string[] | null {
    // Convert wordDict to a Set for O(1) lookup time
    const wordSet = new Set<string>(wordDict);
    
    // Create a DP array where dp[i] stores the list of words for s[0...i-1]
    // If no valid segmentation, store null
    const dp: (string[] | null)[] = new Array(s.length + 1).fill(null);
    
    // Empty string has an empty list of words
    dp[0] = [];
    
    // Iterate through each position i in the string
    for (let i = 1; i <= s.length; i++) {
        // Check every possible substring ending at i by looking at previous positions j
        for (let j = 0; j < i; j++) {
            if (dp[j] !== null) {
                const word = s.substring(j, i);
                if (wordSet.has(word)) {
                    // If this is the first valid segmentation found, or we want to store it
                    dp[i] = [...dp[j], word];
                    break; // Take the first valid segmentation for simplicity
                }
            }
        }
    }
    
    // Return the list of words if the entire string can be segmented, else null
    return dp[s.length];
}

// Test cases to demonstrate the solution with word list output
function runTestsWithList(): void {
    console.log("Test 1:", wordBreakWithList("leetcode", ["leet", "code"])); // Expected: ["leet", "code"]
    console.log("Test 2:", wordBreakWithList("applepenapple", ["apple", "pen"])); // Expected: ["apple", "pen", "apple"]
    console.log("Test 3:", wordBreakWithList("catsandog", ["cats", "dog", "sand", "and", "cat"])); // Expected: null
}

// Run the tests
runTestsWithList();
```

### Explanation of the Extended Solution
- **DP Array**: Now `dp` is typed as `(string[] | null)[]`, storing either a list of words or `null` if no segmentation is possible.
- **Tracking Words**: When a valid split is found, we copy the word list from `dp[j]` and append the current word `s[j...i-1]`.
- **Output**: The final result at `dp[s.length]` is either the list of words or `null` if no segmentation exists.

### Output of Test Cases for Word List
When you run the code, you'll get:
```
Test 1: ["leet", "code"]
Test 2: ["apple", "pen", "apple"]
Test 3: null
```
This matches the expected behavior, showing one possible segmentation when it exists and `null` when it doesn't.

## Conclusion

In this blog post, we've tackled the **Word Break** problem, a medium-difficulty LeetCode challenge that’s a favorite in Silicon Valley interviews at companies like Google and Meta. We introduced the problem and explained it in simple terms using an ELI5 analogy of cutting words into pieces from a book. We then provided two complete TypeScript solutions: one to check if segmentation is possible using dynamic programming, and a follow-up to output the actual list of words in a segmentation. Key takeaways include:
- Dynamic programming is a powerful technique to solve string segmentation by breaking it into subproblems and storing results in a `dp` array.
- TypeScript’s type safety helps ensure our code is robust, with clear typing for inputs, outputs, and data structures like `Set<string>`.
- The time complexity of the solution is $O(n^2)$, making it efficient for typical interview constraints.
- Extending the problem to output the word list shows how to adapt DP solutions for follow-up questions, a common interview scenario.

By mastering problems like Word Break, you're building a strong foundation in dynamic programming, a critical skill for coding interviews. In the next post, we'll explore another exciting LeetCode problem to continue leveling up your skills. Stay tuned, and happy coding!
