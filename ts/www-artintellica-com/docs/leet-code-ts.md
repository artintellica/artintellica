i'd like to make a series of blog posts to study "leet code" in typescript. leet
code, of course, concerns programming data structures and algorithms. the goal
of the series of blog posts is to start with elementary leet code examples and
work up towards more advanced examples. the leet code examples should all
pertain to the sort of things that are likely to be covered in job interviews in
silicon valley.

first, can you give me a list of 10 or so leet cod problems that are likely to
be used in job interviews, starting with more elementary problems and working up
towards more advanced problems? the problems should come in two flavors:
problems that are language-agnostic, and then problems specific to typescript.

# === ASSISTANT ===

I'm excited to help you create a series of blog posts to study LeetCode problems in TypeScript with a focus on job interviews in Silicon Valley. LeetCode is a fantastic resource for preparing for technical interviews, as many companies, especially in tech hubs like Silicon Valley, often use similar problems to test candidates' problem-solving skills, understanding of data structures, and algorithmic thinking.

I'll first provide a list of 10 LeetCode problems that are commonly encountered in job interviews, starting with elementary problems and progressing to more advanced ones. I'll split them into two categories as requested: **language-agnostic problems** (focused on data structures and algorithms that can be solved in any language) and **TypeScript-specific problems** (or problems where TypeScript's features can be highlighted or are particularly relevant, even if the problem itself isn't strictly TypeScript-only). Since LeetCode problems are generally language-agnostic, for the TypeScript-specific category, I'll choose problems where TypeScript's type system, interfaces, or other language features can add value to the explanation or solution.

I'll also include a brief description of each problem, its difficulty level (Easy, Medium, Hard), and why it's relevant for Silicon Valley interviews. These problems are selected based on their frequency in interviews (derived from community feedback, forums like Blind, and resources like "Cracking the Coding Interview") and their ability to test core concepts like arrays, strings, trees, graphs, and dynamic programming.

### TypeScript-Specific LeetCode Problems (or Problems Highlighting TypeScript Features)
Since LeetCode problems are generally language-agnostic, there aren't problems explicitly designed for TypeScript. However, I’ve selected problems where TypeScript’s type system, interfaces, or other features can be emphasized in the solution or explanation. These are still common interview problems, but I’ll note how TypeScript can be leveraged.

1. **Two Sum (Easy)**  
   - **Problem**: Same as above.
   - **TypeScript Focus**: Use TypeScript interfaces to define input and output types (e.g., `number[]` for input and a tuple for indices). Highlight type safety when accessing array elements.
   - **Why It's Relevant**: Same as above; TypeScript’s type annotations can make the code more maintainable and self-documenting, which is valued in team settings at Silicon Valley companies.

2. **Valid Parentheses (Easy)**  
   - **Problem**: Same as above.
   - **TypeScript Focus**: Use TypeScript to define a type for valid characters or use a `Map<string, string>` for matching brackets, showcasing type safety in data structures.
   - **Why It's Relevant**: Same as above; TypeScript’s type system can help catch errors early in development.

3. **Design Hit Counter (Medium)**  
   - **Problem**: Design a hit counter that counts the number of hits received in the last 5 minutes.
   - **TypeScript Focus**: Use classes with proper typing for timestamps and methods. Highlight how interfaces can define the contract for the HitCounter class.
   - **Why It's Relevant**: Design problems are common at companies like Google, and TypeScript’s OOP features can make the solution clearer.

4. **Group Anagrams (Medium)**  
   - **Problem**: Given an array of strings, group the anagrams together.
   - **TypeScript Focus**: Use a `Map<string, string[]>` with explicit typing to store sorted characters as keys and lists of anagrams as values. Discuss how TypeScript prevents type mismatches.
   - **Why It's Relevant**: Tests string manipulation and hash maps, often asked at Amazon and Meta.

5. **Implement Trie (Prefix Tree) (Medium)**  
   - **Problem**: Implement a trie with insert, search, and startsWith methods.
   - **TypeScript Focus**: Define a `TrieNode` interface with optional children and boolean flags for end-of-word. Showcase how TypeScript’s strict typing helps in debugging tree structures.
   - **Why It's Relevant**: Tries are a common data structure for autocomplete features, often tested at companies like Google and Microsoft.

# Merging Two Sorted Lists: A LeetCode Journey in TypeScript

Welcome back to our series on solving LeetCode problems with TypeScript, tailored for cracking those Silicon Valley job interviews! Today, we're diving into an "Easy" yet fundamental problem: **Merge Two Sorted Lists**. This problem is a classic when it comes to understanding linked lists, a data structure that often pops up in technical interviews at companies like Amazon. If you're preparing for a coding interview, mastering linked list operations like merging is essential, as they test your ability to manipulate pointers and maintain order in data.

In this post, we'll break down the problem, explain it in simple terms, provide a TypeScript solution with detailed comments, analyze the time and space complexity, and wrap up with key takeaways. Let's get started!

## Problem Introduction: Merge Two Sorted Lists

The problem statement is straightforward: You are given the heads of two sorted linked lists, `list1` and `list2`. Your task is to merge these two lists into a single sorted list. The merged list should maintain the ascending order of the original lists. The input lists are singly linked lists, meaning each node points to the next node, and the last node points to `null`.

For example:
- Input: `list1 = [1,2,4]`, `list2 = [1,3,4]`
- Output: `[1,1,2,3,4,4]`

This problem is relevant because it tests your understanding of linked list traversal and pointer manipulation—skills that are often assessed in interviews. It also introduces the concept of merging, which can be extended to more complex problems like merging k-sorted lists or sorting algorithms like merge sort.

Key concepts we'll cover:
- Linked list structure and traversal.
- Pointer manipulation to build a new list.
- Iterative vs. recursive approaches to merging.

## ELI5: Merging Two Sorted Lists Explained Like You're Five

Imagine you have two lines of kids, each standing in order from shortest to tallest. One line is `list1` (say, kids with heights 1, 2, 4), and the other is `list2` (kids with heights 1, 3, 4). Your job is to make one big line where everyone is still in order from shortest to tallest.

Here's how you do it:
1. Look at the first kid in each line.
2. Pick the shorter one to stand at the front of the new line.
3. Move forward in the line you picked from.
4. Repeat until you've picked all the kids from both lines.

For example:
- Start: Compare 1 (from `list1`) and 1 (from `list2`). Pick one of them (say, from `list1`). New line: [1].
- Next: Compare 2 (from `list1`) and 1 (from `list2`). Pick 1 from `list2`. New line: [1,1].
- Next: Compare 2 (from `list1`) and 3 (from `list2`). Pick 2. New line: [1,1,2].
- Keep going until the new line is [1,1,2,3,4,4].

In programming, each "kid" is a node in a linked list with a value (height) and a pointer to the next node (the next kid). We use pointers to keep track of where we are in each list and to build the new merged line.

## TypeScript Solution: Merging Two Sorted Lists

Let's implement this in TypeScript. First, we need to define the structure of a linked list node using a class or interface. Then, we'll write a function to merge the two lists iteratively (a recursive solution is also possible, but iterative is more space-efficient).

### Step 1: Define the Linked List Node

```typescript
// Definition for singly-linked list node
class ListNode {
    val: number;
    next: ListNode | null;
    constructor(val?: number, next?: ListNode | null) {
        this.val = val === undefined ? 0 : val;
        this.next = next === undefined ? null : next;
    }
}
```

This `ListNode` class represents a node in the linked list with a value (`val`) and a pointer to the next node (`next`), which can be `null` if it's the last node. TypeScript's type system ensures that `next` is either a `ListNode` or `null`, adding type safety.

### Step 2: Iterative Solution to Merge Two Lists

We'll use an iterative approach with a dummy node to simplify the merging process. The dummy node acts as a placeholder for the head of the merged list, making it easier to handle edge cases (like when one list is empty).

```typescript
function mergeTwoLists(list1: ListNode | null, list2: ListNode | null): ListNode | null {
    // Create a dummy node to serve as the head of the merged list
    const dummy = new ListNode(0);
    // Use a current pointer to build the merged list
    let current = dummy;
    
    // Traverse both lists while neither is empty
    while (list1 !== null && list2 !== null) {
        // Compare values of the current nodes from list1 and list2
        if (list1.val <= list2.val) {
            // If list1's value is smaller or equal, add it to the merged list
            current.next = list1;
            // Move to the next node in list1
            list1 = list1.next;
        } else {
            // If list2's value is smaller, add it to the merged list
            current.next = list2;
            // Move to the next node in list2
            list2 = list2.next;
        }
        // Move the current pointer forward
        current = current.next;
    }
    
    // If list1 still has nodes, append them to the merged list
    if (list1 !== null) {
        current.next = list1;
    }
    // If list2 still has nodes, append them to the merged list
    if (list2 !== null) {
        current.next = list2;
    }
    
    // Return the head of the merged list (skip the dummy node)
    return dummy.next;
}
```

### Explanation of the Code
- **Dummy Node**: We start with a dummy node to avoid special handling for the head of the merged list. Its `next` pointer will point to the actual start of the merged list.
- **Comparison and Merging**: We compare the values of the current nodes from `list1` and `list2`. The smaller (or equal) value is linked to the merged list, and we advance the pointer in the corresponding input list.
- **Remaining Nodes**: Once one list is exhausted, we append the remaining nodes from the other list directly to the merged list.
- **Return**: Finally, we return `dummy.next`, which is the head of the merged list.

### Time and Space Complexity
- **Time Complexity**: $O(n + m)$, where $n$ and $m$ are the lengths of `list1` and `list2`, respectively. We traverse each list once.
- **Space Complexity**: $O(1)$, as we only use a few pointers (dummy and current) regardless of input size. We're reusing the existing nodes without creating new ones.

### Testing the Solution
Let's test this with the example from earlier: `list1 = [1,2,4]` and `list2 = [1,3,4]`.

```typescript
// Helper function to create a linked list from an array (for testing)
function arrayToList(arr: number[]): ListNode | null {
    if (arr.length === 0) return null;
    const dummy = new ListNode(0);
    let current = dummy;
    for (const val of arr) {
        current.next = new ListNode(val);
        current = current.next;
    }
    return dummy.next;
}

// Helper function to convert linked list back to array (for output)
function listToArray(list: ListNode | null): number[] {
    const result: number[] = [];
    let current = list;
    while (current !== null) {
        result.push(current.val);
        current = current.next;
    }
    return result;
}

// Test the merge function
const list1 = arrayToList([1, 2, 4]);
const list2 = arrayToList([1, 3, 4]);
const merged = mergeTwoLists(list1, list2);
console.log(listToArray(merged)); // Output: [1, 1, 2, 3, 4, 4]
```

This test confirms our solution works as expected, producing a sorted merged list.

## Conclusion: Key Takeaways

In this blog post, we tackled the LeetCode problem "Merge Two Sorted Lists," a common interview question that tests linked list manipulation and pointer logic. Here's what we learned:
- **Linked Lists Basics**: We defined a `ListNode` class in TypeScript to represent nodes in a singly linked list, leveraging type safety for `next` pointers.
- **Merging Logic**: We used an iterative approach with a dummy node to merge two sorted lists, comparing values and linking nodes in ascending order.
- **Efficiency**: Our solution runs in $O(n + m)$ time with $O(1)$ space, making it optimal for interviews where performance matters.
- **Practical Testing**: We included helper functions to test the solution, ensuring it handles real input correctly.

This problem is a stepping stone to more complex linked list challenges and merging scenarios, often seen in Amazon interviews. By mastering this, you're building a solid foundation for data structure questions. In the next post, we'll explore another fundamental topic to further sharpen your skills. Stay tuned, and happy coding!
