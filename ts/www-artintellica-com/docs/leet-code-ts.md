i'd like to make a series of blog posts to study "leet code" in typescript. leet
code, of course, concerns programming data structures and algorithms. the goal
of the series of blog posts is to start with elementary leet code examples and
work up towards more advanced examples. the leet code examples should all
pertain to the sort of things that are likely to be covered in job interviews in
silicon valley.

first, can you give me a list of 10 or so leet cod problems that are likely to
be used in job interviews, starting with more elementary problems and working up
towards more advanced problems? the problems should come in two flavors:
problems that are language-agnostic, and then problems specific to typescript.

I'm excited to help you create a series of blog posts to study LeetCode problems in TypeScript with a focus on job interviews in Silicon Valley. LeetCode is a fantastic resource for preparing for technical interviews, as many companies, especially in tech hubs like Silicon Valley, often use similar problems to test candidates' problem-solving skills, understanding of data structures, and algorithmic thinking.

I'll first provide a list of 10 LeetCode problems that are commonly encountered in job interviews, starting with elementary problems and progressing to more advanced ones. I'll split them into two categories as requested: **language-agnostic problems** (focused on data structures and algorithms that can be solved in any language) and **TypeScript-specific problems** (or problems where TypeScript's features can be highlighted or are particularly relevant, even if the problem itself isn't strictly TypeScript-only). Since LeetCode problems are generally language-agnostic, for the TypeScript-specific category, I'll choose problems where TypeScript's type system, interfaces, or other language features can add value to the explanation or solution.

I'll also include a brief description of each problem, its difficulty level (Easy, Medium, Hard), and why it's relevant for Silicon Valley interviews. These problems are selected based on their frequency in interviews (derived from community feedback, forums like Blind, and resources like "Cracking the Coding Interview") and their ability to test core concepts like arrays, strings, trees, graphs, and dynamic programming.

### TypeScript-Specific LeetCode Problems (or Problems Highlighting TypeScript Features)
Since LeetCode problems are generally language-agnostic, there aren't problems explicitly designed for TypeScript. However, I’ve selected problems where TypeScript’s type system, interfaces, or other features can be emphasized in the solution or explanation. These are still common interview problems, but I’ll note how TypeScript can be leveraged.

1. **Two Sum (Easy)**  
   - **Problem**: Same as above.
   - **TypeScript Focus**: Use TypeScript interfaces to define input and output types (e.g., `number[]` for input and a tuple for indices). Highlight type safety when accessing array elements.
   - **Why It's Relevant**: Same as above; TypeScript’s type annotations can make the code more maintainable and self-documenting, which is valued in team settings at Silicon Valley companies.

2. **Valid Parentheses (Easy)**  
   - **Problem**: Same as above.
   - **TypeScript Focus**: Use TypeScript to define a type for valid characters or use a `Map<string, string>` for matching brackets, showcasing type safety in data structures.
   - **Why It's Relevant**: Same as above; TypeScript’s type system can help catch errors early in development.

3. **Design Hit Counter (Medium)**  
   - **Problem**: Design a hit counter that counts the number of hits received in the last 5 minutes.
   - **TypeScript Focus**: Use classes with proper typing for timestamps and methods. Highlight how interfaces can define the contract for the HitCounter class.
   - **Why It's Relevant**: Design problems are common at companies like Google, and TypeScript’s OOP features can make the solution clearer.

4. **Group Anagrams (Medium)**  
   - **Problem**: Given an array of strings, group the anagrams together.
   - **TypeScript Focus**: Use a `Map<string, string[]>` with explicit typing to store sorted characters as keys and lists of anagrams as values. Discuss how TypeScript prevents type mismatches.
   - **Why It's Relevant**: Tests string manipulation and hash maps, often asked at Amazon and Meta.

5. **Implement Trie (Prefix Tree) (Medium)**  
   - **Problem**: Implement a trie with insert, search, and startsWith methods.
   - **TypeScript Focus**: Define a `TrieNode` interface with optional children and boolean flags for end-of-word. Showcase how TypeScript’s strict typing helps in debugging tree structures.
   - **Why It's Relevant**: Tries are a common data structure for autocomplete features, often tested at companies like Google and Microsoft.

### Why This Selection for Silicon Valley Interviews?
- **Elementary Problems (Easy)**: Problems like Two Sum, Valid Parentheses, and Reverse Linked List are often used in phone screens or early rounds to assess basic problem-solving and familiarity with data structures.
- **Medium Problems**: Problems like Longest Substring, Merge Intervals, and Group Anagrams test intermediate skills like sliding windows, sorting, and hash maps, which are staples in onsite interviews.
- **Hard Problems**: Problems like Median of Two Sorted Arrays and LRU Cache are used in later rounds or for senior roles to test deep algorithmic thinking and design skills.
- **TypeScript Focus**: While TypeScript isn’t typically a requirement in interviews, showcasing type safety and modern JavaScript practices can set you apart, especially for frontend or full-stack roles at companies like Meta or Google, where TypeScript is widely used.

### Structure for Your Blog Series
You can structure your blog posts by difficulty and theme, dedicating each post to one problem or a set of related problems. Here’s a suggested outline for the series:
