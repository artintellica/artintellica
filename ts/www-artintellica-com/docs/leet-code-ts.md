i'd like to make a series of blog posts to study "leet code" in typescript. leet
code, of course, concerns programming data structures and algorithms. the goal
of the series of blog posts is to start with elementary leet code examples and
work up towards more advanced examples. the leet code examples should all
pertain to the sort of things that are likely to be covered in job interviews in
silicon valley.

first, can you give me a list of 10 or so leet cod problems that are likely to
be used in job interviews, starting with more elementary problems and working up
towards more advanced problems? the problems should come in two flavors:
problems that are language-agnostic, and then problems specific to typescript.

# === ASSISTANT ===

I'm excited to help you create a series of blog posts to study LeetCode problems in TypeScript with a focus on job interviews in Silicon Valley. LeetCode is a fantastic resource for preparing for technical interviews, as many companies, especially in tech hubs like Silicon Valley, often use similar problems to test candidates' problem-solving skills, understanding of data structures, and algorithmic thinking.

I'll first provide a list of 10 LeetCode problems that are commonly encountered in job interviews, starting with elementary problems and progressing to more advanced ones. I'll split them into two categories as requested: **language-agnostic problems** (focused on data structures and algorithms that can be solved in any language) and **TypeScript-specific problems** (or problems where TypeScript's features can be highlighted or are particularly relevant, even if the problem itself isn't strictly TypeScript-only). Since LeetCode problems are generally language-agnostic, for the TypeScript-specific category, I'll choose problems where TypeScript's type system, interfaces, or other language features can add value to the explanation or solution.

I'll also include a brief description of each problem, its difficulty level (Easy, Medium, Hard), and why it's relevant for Silicon Valley interviews. These problems are selected based on their frequency in interviews (derived from community feedback, forums like Blind, and resources like "Cracking the Coding Interview") and their ability to test core concepts like arrays, strings, trees, graphs, and dynamic programming.

### TypeScript-Specific LeetCode Problems (or Problems Highlighting TypeScript Features)
Since LeetCode problems are generally language-agnostic, there aren't problems explicitly designed for TypeScript. However, I’ve selected problems where TypeScript’s type system, interfaces, or other features can be emphasized in the solution or explanation. These are still common interview problems, but I’ll note how TypeScript can be leveraged.

1. **Two Sum (Easy)**  
   - **Problem**: Same as above.
   - **TypeScript Focus**: Use TypeScript interfaces to define input and output types (e.g., `number[]` for input and a tuple for indices). Highlight type safety when accessing array elements.
   - **Why It's Relevant**: Same as above; TypeScript’s type annotations can make the code more maintainable and self-documenting, which is valued in team settings at Silicon Valley companies.

2. **Valid Parentheses (Easy)**  
   - **Problem**: Same as above.
   - **TypeScript Focus**: Use TypeScript to define a type for valid characters or use a `Map<string, string>` for matching brackets, showcasing type safety in data structures.
   - **Why It's Relevant**: Same as above; TypeScript’s type system can help catch errors early in development.

3. **Design Hit Counter (Medium)**  
   - **Problem**: Design a hit counter that counts the number of hits received in the last 5 minutes.
   - **TypeScript Focus**: Use classes with proper typing for timestamps and methods. Highlight how interfaces can define the contract for the HitCounter class.
   - **Why It's Relevant**: Design problems are common at companies like Google, and TypeScript’s OOP features can make the solution clearer.

4. **Group Anagrams (Medium)**  
   - **Problem**: Given an array of strings, group the anagrams together.
   - **TypeScript Focus**: Use a `Map<string, string[]>` with explicit typing to store sorted characters as keys and lists of anagrams as values. Discuss how TypeScript prevents type mismatches.
   - **Why It's Relevant**: Tests string manipulation and hash maps, often asked at Amazon and Meta.

5. **Implement Trie (Prefix Tree) (Medium)**  
   - **Problem**: Implement a trie with insert, search, and startsWith methods.
   - **TypeScript Focus**: Define a `TrieNode` interface with optional children and boolean flags for end-of-word. Showcase how TypeScript’s strict typing helps in debugging tree structures.
   - **Why It's Relevant**: Tries are a common data structure for autocomplete features, often tested at companies like Google and Microsoft.

# Mastering the LRU Cache: A Key Interview Problem in TypeScript

Welcome back to our series on solving LeetCode problems with TypeScript, tailored for Silicon Valley job interviews! Today, we're diving into a fascinating and challenging problem: designing and implementing a **Least Recently Used (LRU) Cache**. This problem is a staple in technical interviews, especially at top-tier companies like Amazon and Google, as it tests your ability to combine data structures like hash maps and doubly linked lists into an efficient design. Whether you're preparing for a coding round or a system design-adjacent question, mastering the LRU Cache will give you a significant edge. Let's break it down step by step, explore the problem with an easy-to-understand analogy, and implement a solution in TypeScript.

## Introduction to the LRU Cache Problem

The LRU Cache problem (LeetCode #146) is classified as Medium to Hard due to its requirement for a deep understanding of data structure design. The task is to create a cache with a fixed capacity that stores key-value pairs. When the cache reaches its capacity, it should evict the least recently used item to make room for a new one. Additionally, both getting and putting items in the cache should be performed in $O(1)$ time complexity, which means we need an efficient way to track usage order and access elements quickly.

This problem is highly relevant for interviews because it mimics real-world scenarios like caching in web browsers or databases, where quick access and efficient memory management are critical. It tests your ability to:
- Use a hash map for fast lookups.
- Maintain order with a doubly linked list for quick insertion and deletion.
- Combine multiple data structures into a cohesive design.

In Silicon Valley interviews, especially at companies like Amazon and Google, you might encounter this as part of a coding round or even as a precursor to a broader system design discussion. Let's simplify the concept before diving into the technical details.

## ELI5: Understanding LRU Cache Like a Toy Box

Imagine you have a small toy box that can only hold 3 toys at a time. Every time you play with a toy, you put it on top of the pile in the box because it's the "most recently used." If the box is full and you want to add a new toy, you have to take out the toy at the bottom of the pile—the one you haven't played with in the longest time (the "least recently used"). To find a toy quickly, you also have a little notebook where you write down which toy is in which spot in the box.

In this analogy:
- The toy box is the cache with a fixed capacity.
- The toys are the key-value pairs (data) you're storing.
- The pile order (top to bottom) represents how recently each toy was used.
- The notebook is like a hash map, letting you find a toy instantly without digging through the box.
- Adding a new toy or playing with an existing one means updating both the pile (order of usage) and the notebook (quick lookup).

The challenge is to make sure that finding a toy, playing with it (moving it to the top), or replacing the bottom toy with a new one all happen super fast, without rearranging the whole box every time. That's what we'll solve with our data structures!

## Designing the LRU Cache: Key Concepts

To achieve $O(1)$ time complexity for both `get` and `put` operations, we need two main data structures:
1. **Hash Map**: For instant lookups of cache items by key. It will store keys mapped to nodes in our linked list.
2. **Doubly Linked List**: To maintain the order of usage. The most recently used item will be at the head (front), and the least recently used will be at the tail (end). A doubly linked list allows us to move nodes (update order) or remove them in $O(1)$ time because each node has pointers to both the previous and next nodes.

Here's the strategy:
- When we `get` a key, we find it in the hash map, move its node to the head of the linked list (marking it as most recently used), and return its value.
- When we `put` a key-value pair, if the key exists, we update its value and move it to the head. If it doesn't exist and the cache is full, we remove the tail node (least recently used), update the hash map, and add the new node to the head. If there's space, we simply add the new node to the head.
- We use dummy head and tail nodes in the doubly linked list to simplify edge cases (like removing the first or last node).

Let's implement this in TypeScript, leveraging type safety to make our code robust and clear.

## TypeScript Implementation of LRU Cache

We'll start by defining the structure of our doubly linked list node and then build the LRU Cache class with all required functionality. Below is the complete solution with detailed comments explaining each part.

```typescript
// Define the structure of a node in the doubly linked list
interface Node {
    key: number;
    value: number;
    prev: Node | null;
    next: Node | null;
}

class LRUCache {
    private capacity: number; // Maximum number of items the cache can hold
    private cache: Map<number, Node>; // Hash map for O(1) lookup of nodes by key
    private dummyHead: Node; // Dummy head node for the doubly linked list
    private dummyTail: Node; // Dummy tail node for the doubly linked list

    constructor(capacity: number) {
        this.capacity = capacity;
        this.cache = new Map<number, Node>();
        // Initialize dummy head and tail to simplify list operations
        this.dummyHead = { key: 0, value: 0, prev: null, next: null };
        this.dummyTail = { key: 0, value: 0, prev: null, next: null };
        this.dummyHead.next = this.dummyTail;
        this.dummyTail.prev = this.dummyHead;
    }

    // Helper method to add a node right after the head
    private addNode(node: Node): void {
        node.prev = this.dummyHead;
        node.next = this.dummyHead.next;
        this.dummyHead.next!.prev = node;
        this.dummyHead.next = node;
    }

    // Helper method to remove an existing node from the linked list
    private removeNode(node: Node): void {
        const prev = node.prev;
        const next = node.next;
        prev!.next = next;
        next!.prev = prev;
    }

    // Helper method to move a node to the head (most recently used)
    private moveToHead(node: Node): void {
        this.removeNode(node);
        this.addNode(node);
    }

    // Get the value associated with a key if it exists in the cache
    get(key: number): number {
        const node = this.cache.get(key);
        if (!node) {
            return -1; // Key not found
        }
        // Move to head (mark as most recently used)
        this.moveToHead(node);
        return node.value;
    }

    // Put a key-value pair into the cache
    put(key: number, value: number): void {
        const node = this.cache.get(key);
        if (node) {
            // If key exists, update its value and move to head
            node.value = value;
            this.moveToHead(node);
        } else {
            // Create a new node
            const newNode: Node = { key, value, prev: null, next: null };
            this.cache.set(key, newNode);
            this.addNode(newNode);

            // If over capacity, remove the least recently used item (tail)
            if (this.cache.size > this.capacity) {
                // Remove from hash map and linked list
                const tail = this.dummyTail.prev!;
                this.cache.delete(tail.key);
                this.removeNode(tail);
            }
        }
    }
}

// Example usage and testing
function testLRUCache() {
    const cache = new LRUCache(2);
    cache.put(1, 1); // Cache is {1=1}
    cache.put(2, 2); // Cache is {1=1, 2=2}
    console.log(cache.get(1)); // Returns 1
    cache.put(3, 3); // Evicts key 2, cache is {1=1, 3=3}
    console.log(cache.get(2)); // Returns -1 (not found)
    cache.put(4, 4); // Evicts key 1, cache is {4=4, 3=3}
    console.log(cache.get(1)); // Returns -1 (not found)
    console.log(cache.get(3)); // Returns 3
    console.log(cache.get(4)); // Returns 4
}

testLRUCache();
```

### Explanation of the Code
- **Node Interface**: Defines the structure of each node in the doubly linked list with `key`, `value`, and pointers to `prev` and `next` nodes. TypeScript's type safety ensures we don't mix up properties.
- **LRUCache Class**: Contains the main logic with a `Map` for $O(1)$ lookups and a doubly linked list for maintaining order.
- **Helper Methods**: `addNode`, `removeNode`, and `moveToHead` manage the linked list operations efficiently.
- **get Method**: Retrieves a value by key, updates the usage order, and returns -1 if not found.
- **put Method**: Adds or updates a key-value pair, evicts the least recently used item if necessary, and maintains the order.
- **Time Complexity**: Both `get` and `put` operations are $O(1)$ because hash map lookups and doubly linked list node movements (thanks to direct pointers) are constant time.
- **Space Complexity**: $O(capacity)$ to store the key-value pairs in the hash map and linked list.

### Why TypeScript Shines Here
TypeScript's `Map` and interface definitions make the code more readable and less error-prone. For instance, explicitly typing the `cache` as `Map<number, Node>` ensures that we only store nodes associated with numeric keys, catching potential bugs during development. This is particularly useful in a collaborative environment or when maintaining code over time, which aligns with practices at Silicon Valley companies.

## Conclusion: Key Takeaways from LRU Cache

In this blog post, we've tackled the LRU Cache problem, a medium-to-hard LeetCode challenge that's a favorite in Silicon Valley interviews at companies like Amazon and Google. Here's what we learned:
- The LRU Cache requires $O(1)$ time complexity for operations, achieved by combining a hash map (for lookups) and a doubly linked list (for order maintenance).
- We broke down the concept using a toy box analogy, making it clear how "most recently used" and "least recently used" items are managed.
- Our TypeScript implementation leverages type safety with interfaces and explicit typing, ensuring robust and maintainable code.
- Key operations like `get` and `put` were implemented with helper methods to manage the doubly linked list efficiently.

Mastering the LRU Cache not only prepares you for coding interviews but also deepens your understanding of data structure design—a critical skill for real-world applications. In the next post, we'll explore another challenging problem to further build your algorithmic toolkit. Until then, keep practicing, and happy coding!
