i'd like to make a series of blog posts to study "leet code" in typescript. leet
code, of course, concerns programming data structures and algorithms. the goal
of the series of blog posts is to start with elementary leet code examples and
work up towards more advanced examples. the leet code examples should all
pertain to the sort of things that are likely to be covered in job interviews in
silicon valley.

first, can you give me a list of 10 or so leet cod problems that are likely to
be used in job interviews, starting with more elementary problems and working up
towards more advanced problems? the problems should come in two flavors:
problems that are language-agnostic, and then problems specific to typescript.

# === ASSISTANT ===

I'm excited to help you create a series of blog posts to study LeetCode problems in TypeScript with a focus on job interviews in Silicon Valley. LeetCode is a fantastic resource for preparing for technical interviews, as many companies, especially in tech hubs like Silicon Valley, often use similar problems to test candidates' problem-solving skills, understanding of data structures, and algorithmic thinking.

I'll first provide a list of 10 LeetCode problems that are commonly encountered in job interviews, starting with elementary problems and progressing to more advanced ones. I'll split them into two categories as requested: **language-agnostic problems** (focused on data structures and algorithms that can be solved in any language) and **TypeScript-specific problems** (or problems where TypeScript's features can be highlighted or are particularly relevant, even if the problem itself isn't strictly TypeScript-only). Since LeetCode problems are generally language-agnostic, for the TypeScript-specific category, I'll choose problems where TypeScript's type system, interfaces, or other language features can add value to the explanation or solution.

I'll also include a brief description of each problem, its difficulty level (Easy, Medium, Hard), and why it's relevant for Silicon Valley interviews. These problems are selected based on their frequency in interviews (derived from community feedback, forums like Blind, and resources like "Cracking the Coding Interview") and their ability to test core concepts like arrays, strings, trees, graphs, and dynamic programming.

### TypeScript-Specific LeetCode Problems (or Problems Highlighting TypeScript Features)
Since LeetCode problems are generally language-agnostic, there aren't problems explicitly designed for TypeScript. However, I’ve selected problems where TypeScript’s type system, interfaces, or other features can be emphasized in the solution or explanation. These are still common interview problems, but I’ll note how TypeScript can be leveraged.

1. **Two Sum (Easy)**  
   - **Problem**: Same as above.
   - **TypeScript Focus**: Use TypeScript interfaces to define input and output types (e.g., `number[]` for input and a tuple for indices). Highlight type safety when accessing array elements.
   - **Why It's Relevant**: Same as above; TypeScript’s type annotations can make the code more maintainable and self-documenting, which is valued in team settings at Silicon Valley companies.

2. **Valid Parentheses (Easy)**  
   - **Problem**: Same as above.
   - **TypeScript Focus**: Use TypeScript to define a type for valid characters or use a `Map<string, string>` for matching brackets, showcasing type safety in data structures.
   - **Why It's Relevant**: Same as above; TypeScript’s type system can help catch errors early in development.

3. **Design Hit Counter (Medium)**  
   - **Problem**: Design a hit counter that counts the number of hits received in the last 5 minutes.
   - **TypeScript Focus**: Use classes with proper typing for timestamps and methods. Highlight how interfaces can define the contract for the HitCounter class.
   - **Why It's Relevant**: Design problems are common at companies like Google, and TypeScript’s OOP features can make the solution clearer.

4. **Group Anagrams (Medium)**  
   - **Problem**: Given an array of strings, group the anagrams together.
   - **TypeScript Focus**: Use a `Map<string, string[]>` with explicit typing to store sorted characters as keys and lists of anagrams as values. Discuss how TypeScript prevents type mismatches.
   - **Why It's Relevant**: Tests string manipulation and hash maps, often asked at Amazon and Meta.

5. **Implement Trie (Prefix Tree) (Medium)**  
   - **Problem**: Implement a trie with insert, search, and startsWith methods.
   - **TypeScript Focus**: Define a `TrieNode` interface with optional children and boolean flags for end-of-word. Showcase how TypeScript’s strict typing helps in debugging tree structures.
   - **Why It's Relevant**: Tries are a common data structure for autocomplete features, often tested at companies like Google and Microsoft.

---

### Why This Selection for Silicon Valley Interviews?
- **Elementary Problems (Easy)**: Problems like Two Sum, Valid Parentheses, and Reverse Linked List are often used in phone screens or early rounds to assess basic problem-solving and familiarity with data structures.
- **Medium Problems**: Problems like Longest Substring, Merge Intervals, and Group Anagrams test intermediate skills like sliding windows, sorting, and hash maps, which are staples in onsite interviews.
- **Hard Problems**: Problems like Median of Two Sorted Arrays and LRU Cache are used in later rounds or for senior roles to test deep algorithmic thinking and design skills.
- **TypeScript Focus**: While TypeScript isn’t typically a requirement in interviews, showcasing type safety and modern JavaScript practices can set you apart, especially for frontend or full-stack roles at companies like Meta or Google, where TypeScript is widely used.

### Structure for Your Blog Series
You can structure your blog posts by difficulty and theme, dedicating each post to one problem or a set of related problems. Here’s a suggested outline for the series:

# Mastering LeetCode: Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock with TypeScript

Welcome back to our LeetCode journey with TypeScript! In this post, we're diving into a classic problem that frequently appears in technical interviews, especially at companies like Google and in hedge fund tech roles: **Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock**. This problem tests your ability to work with arrays and apply a greedy algorithm to maximize profit. Whether you're preparing for a Silicon Valley interview or just sharpening your algorithmic skills, this problem offers valuable insights into efficient array traversal. Let's break it down step by step, explore the concept with an ELI5 analogy, and implement a solution in TypeScript.

## Introduction to Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock

The problem is straightforward: you're given an array of stock prices where each element represents the price of a stock on a particular day. Your goal is to maximize your profit by buying the stock on one day and selling it on a later day. If no profit is possible, you should return 0.

- **Input**: An array of numbers representing daily stock prices, e.g., `[7,1,5,3,6,4]`.
- **Output**: The maximum profit you can make, e.g., for the input above, the maximum profit is 5 (buy at 1, sell at 6).
- **Constraints**: You must buy before selling, and you can only buy and sell once. If no profit is possible, return 0.

This problem falls into the "Easy to Medium" difficulty range on LeetCode because while the concept is simple, identifying the optimal strategy requires understanding how to minimize the buying price while maximizing the selling price. It introduces the greedy algorithm approach, where at each step, we make a locally optimal choice hoping it leads to a globally optimal solution.

## ELI5: Understanding the Problem Like You're Five

Imagine you're at a candy store every day for a week, and each day the price of your favorite candy changes. You have a little bit of money, and you want to make the most extra money by buying the candy on a cheap day and selling it to your friend on a day when it's more expensive. But you can only buy once and sell once, and you have to sell after you buy.

- On Monday, candy costs 7 coins.
- On Tuesday, it’s only 1 coin (super cheap!).
- On Wednesday, it’s 5 coins.
- On Thursday, it’s 3 coins.
- On Friday, it’s 6 coins.
- On Saturday, it’s 4 coins.

If you buy on Tuesday for 1 coin and sell on Friday for 6 coins, you make 5 coins of profit. That’s the best you can do! If the prices only went down every day, you’d make 0 profit because you wouldn’t sell at a loss. So, your job is to look at all the days, find the cheapest day to buy, and the most expensive day after that to sell, to make the most money.

## Key Concepts: Arrays and Greedy Algorithms

Before we jump into the code, let's clarify the key concepts this problem tests:
- **Arrays**: The input is a simple list of numbers, and we need to traverse it efficiently to compare prices.
- **Greedy Algorithm**: Instead of checking every possible buy-sell pair (which would be slow with a time complexity of $O(n^2)$), we use a greedy approach. We keep track of the minimum price seen so far (the best time to buy) and update the maximum profit if selling at the current price yields a better result. This reduces the time complexity to $O(n)$, where $n$ is the length of the array.

The idea is to iterate through the array once, maintaining two variables:
- The lowest price seen so far (to buy at the cheapest point).
- The maximum profit possible (updated by checking if selling at the current price beats the previous best profit).

## TypeScript Solution: Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock

Let's implement the solution in TypeScript. We'll define the function with proper type annotations to ensure clarity and type safety, which is one of the benefits of using TypeScript over plain JavaScript.

```typescript
function maxProfit(prices: number[]): number {
    // If the array is empty or has only one element, no profit is possible
    if (prices.length < 2) {
        return 0;
    }
    
    // Initialize variables:
    // minPrice is the lowest price seen so far (best time to buy)
    // maxProfit is the maximum profit we can make
    let minPrice: number = prices[0];
    let maxProfit: number = 0;
    
    // Iterate through the array starting from the second element
    for (let i = 1; i < prices.length; i++) {
        const currentPrice = prices[i];
        
        // Update minPrice if the current price is lower
        if (currentPrice < minPrice) {
            minPrice = currentPrice;
        }
        // Update maxProfit if selling at current price gives a better profit
        else {
            const potentialProfit = currentPrice - minPrice;
            maxProfit = Math.max(maxProfit, potentialProfit);
        }
    }
    
    return maxProfit;
}
```

### How It Works
- We first check if the array has fewer than 2 elements. If so, no transaction is possible, so we return 0.
- We initialize `minPrice` as the first price in the array (the first possible buying point) and `maxProfit` as 0 (no profit yet).
- We loop through the array starting from the second element:
  - If the current price is lower than `minPrice`, we update `minPrice` because buying cheaper is always better.
  - If the current price is higher, we calculate the potential profit by subtracting `minPrice` from the current price and update `maxProfit` if this profit is larger than the previous maximum.
- Finally, we return `maxProfit`.

### Example Walkthrough
Let's test it with the example `[7,1,5,3,6,4]`:
- Day 0: Price = 7, minPrice = 7, maxProfit = 0
- Day 1: Price = 1, minPrice = 1 (updated), maxProfit = 0
- Day 2: Price = 5, minPrice = 1, maxProfit = 4 (5-1=4)
- Day 3: Price = 3, minPrice = 1, maxProfit = 4 (3-1=2, no update)
- Day 4: Price = 6, minPrice = 1, maxProfit = 5 (6-1=5, updated)
- Day 5: Price = 4, minPrice = 1, maxProfit = 5 (4-1=3, no update)
- Result: maxProfit = 5

### Time and Space Complexity
- **Time Complexity**: $O(n)$, where $n$ is the length of the prices array. We only traverse the array once.
- **Space Complexity**: $O(1)$, as we only use two variables regardless of input size.

### Test Cases
Let's run a few test cases to verify our solution:

```typescript
console.log(maxProfit([7,1,5,3,6,4])); // Output: 5 (buy at 1, sell at 6)
console.log(maxProfit([7,6,4,3,1])); // Output: 0 (no profit possible)
console.log(maxProfit([1,2])); // Output: 1 (buy at 1, sell at 2)
console.log(maxProfit([2])); // Output: 0 (can't sell)
```

## Bonus Exercise: Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock II

As a bonus, let's tackle a related problem often asked in interviews: **Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock II**. Here, you can buy and sell multiple times, as long as you sell before buying again. The goal is still to maximize profit.

- **Input**: An array of stock prices, e.g., `[7,1,5,3,6,4]`.
- **Output**: The maximum profit, e.g., for the input above, the maximum profit is 7 (buy at 1, sell at 5 for 4 profit; buy at 3, sell at 6 for 3 profit; total = 7).

### TypeScript Solution for Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock II

```typescript
function maxProfitII(prices: number[]): number {
    // If the array is empty or has only one element, no profit is possible
    if (prices.length < 2) {
        return 0;
    }
    
    // Initialize total profit
    let totalProfit: number = 0;
    
    // Iterate through the array
    for (let i = 1; i < prices.length; i++) {
        // If current price is higher than previous day's price,
        // we can make a profit by buying yesterday and selling today
        if (prices[i] > prices[i - 1]) {
            totalProfit += prices[i] - prices[i - 1];
        }
    }
    
    return totalProfit;
}
```

### How It Works
- Since we can buy and sell multiple times, we take advantage of every upward price movement.
- We iterate through the array, and whenever the current price is higher than the previous day's price, we add the difference to our profit (effectively buying at the lower price and selling at the higher price).
- This greedy approach captures all possible profits because every increase in price can be a separate transaction.

### Example Walkthrough for `[7,1,5,3,6,4]`
- Day 1: Price 1 vs 7, no profit (price decreased)
- Day 2: Price 5 vs 1, profit += 4 (5-1)
- Day 3: Price 3 vs 5, no profit (price decreased)
- Day 4: Price 6 vs 3, profit += 3 (6-3)
- Day 5: Price 4 vs 6, no profit (price decreased)
- Result: totalProfit = 7

### Time and Space Complexity
- **Time Complexity**: $O(n)$, where $n$ is the length of the prices array. Single pass through the array.
- **Space Complexity**: $O(1)$, using only a single variable.

### Test Cases
```typescript
console.log(maxProfitII([7,1,5,3,6,4])); // Output: 7
console.log(maxProfitII([1,2,3,4,5])); // Output: 4 (profit on each consecutive day)
console.log(maxProfitII([7,6,4,3,1])); // Output: 0 (no profit possible)
```

## Conclusion

In this blog post, we've explored the **Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock** problem, a staple in technical interviews that tests array traversal and greedy algorithms. We started with an introduction to the problem, broke it down with an ELI5 analogy (buying and selling candy for profit), and implemented a solution in TypeScript with a time complexity of $O(n)$. We also tackled a bonus problem, **Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock II**, which allows multiple transactions and further reinforces the greedy approach.

Key takeaways:
- Use a greedy strategy to track the minimum price seen so far and update the maximum profit for the single-transaction version.
- For multiple transactions, capture every price increase as a separate profit opportunity.
- TypeScript's type annotations (like `number[]` for the input array) add clarity and prevent runtime errors.

These problems are excellent for practicing array manipulation and understanding how greedy algorithms can simplify seemingly complex tasks. As you prepare for Silicon Valley interviews, mastering such problems will boost your confidence in handling real-world optimization challenges. Stay tuned for the next post in our series, where we'll dive into more medium-difficulty LeetCode problems with TypeScript!
