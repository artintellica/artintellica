i'd like to make a series of blog posts to study "leet code" in typescript. leet
code, of course, concerns programming data structures and algorithms. the goal
of the series of blog posts is to start with elementary leet code examples and
work up towards more advanced examples. the leet code examples should all
pertain to the sort of things that are likely to be covered in job interviews in
silicon valley.

first, can you give me a list of 10 or so leet cod problems that are likely to
be used in job interviews, starting with more elementary problems and working up
towards more advanced problems? the problems should come in two flavors:
problems that are language-agnostic, and then problems specific to typescript.

# === ASSISTANT ===

I'm excited to help you create a series of blog posts to study LeetCode problems in TypeScript with a focus on job interviews in Silicon Valley. LeetCode is a fantastic resource for preparing for technical interviews, as many companies, especially in tech hubs like Silicon Valley, often use similar problems to test candidates' problem-solving skills, understanding of data structures, and algorithmic thinking.

I'll first provide a list of 10 LeetCode problems that are commonly encountered in job interviews, starting with elementary problems and progressing to more advanced ones. I'll split them into two categories as requested: **language-agnostic problems** (focused on data structures and algorithms that can be solved in any language) and **TypeScript-specific problems** (or problems where TypeScript's features can be highlighted or are particularly relevant, even if the problem itself isn't strictly TypeScript-only). Since LeetCode problems are generally language-agnostic, for the TypeScript-specific category, I'll choose problems where TypeScript's type system, interfaces, or other language features can add value to the explanation or solution.

I'll also include a brief description of each problem, its difficulty level (Easy, Medium, Hard), and why it's relevant for Silicon Valley interviews. These problems are selected based on their frequency in interviews (derived from community feedback, forums like Blind, and resources like "Cracking the Coding Interview") and their ability to test core concepts like arrays, strings, trees, graphs, and dynamic programming.

### TypeScript-Specific LeetCode Problems (or Problems Highlighting TypeScript Features)
Since LeetCode problems are generally language-agnostic, there aren't problems explicitly designed for TypeScript. However, I’ve selected problems where TypeScript’s type system, interfaces, or other features can be emphasized in the solution or explanation. These are still common interview problems, but I’ll note how TypeScript can be leveraged.

1. **Two Sum (Easy)**  
   - **Problem**: Same as above.
   - **TypeScript Focus**: Use TypeScript interfaces to define input and output types (e.g., `number[]` for input and a tuple for indices). Highlight type safety when accessing array elements.
   - **Why It's Relevant**: Same as above; TypeScript’s type annotations can make the code more maintainable and self-documenting, which is valued in team settings at Silicon Valley companies.

2. **Valid Parentheses (Easy)**  
   - **Problem**: Same as above.
   - **TypeScript Focus**: Use TypeScript to define a type for valid characters or use a `Map<string, string>` for matching brackets, showcasing type safety in data structures.
   - **Why It's Relevant**: Same as above; TypeScript’s type system can help catch errors early in development.

3. **Design Hit Counter (Medium)**  
   - **Problem**: Design a hit counter that counts the number of hits received in the last 5 minutes.
   - **TypeScript Focus**: Use classes with proper typing for timestamps and methods. Highlight how interfaces can define the contract for the HitCounter class.
   - **Why It's Relevant**: Design problems are common at companies like Google, and TypeScript’s OOP features can make the solution clearer.

4. **Group Anagrams (Medium)**  
   - **Problem**: Given an array of strings, group the anagrams together.
   - **TypeScript Focus**: Use a `Map<string, string[]>` with explicit typing to store sorted characters as keys and lists of anagrams as values. Discuss how TypeScript prevents type mismatches.
   - **Why It's Relevant**: Tests string manipulation and hash maps, often asked at Amazon and Meta.

5. **Implement Trie (Prefix Tree) (Medium)**  
   - **Problem**: Implement a trie with insert, search, and startsWith methods.
   - **TypeScript Focus**: Define a `TrieNode` interface with optional children and boolean flags for end-of-word. Showcase how TypeScript’s strict typing helps in debugging tree structures.
   - **Why It's Relevant**: Tries are a common data structure for autocomplete features, often tested at companies like Google and Microsoft.

# LeetCode in TypeScript: Solving Valid Parentheses (Easy)

Welcome back to our series on tackling LeetCode problems with TypeScript! In this post, we're diving into a classic easy-level problem called **Valid Parentheses**. This problem is a fantastic way to explore fundamental concepts like stacks and string manipulation, which are often tested in technical interviews, especially for entry-level roles at companies like Apple. Whether you're new to coding or brushing up for a Silicon Valley interview, this problem offers a great opportunity to build your skills. Let's break it down step by step with TypeScript, including type safety to make our solution robust and maintainable.

## Introduction to Valid Parentheses

The Valid Parentheses problem is straightforward but tests your ability to handle structured data and logic. Here's the problem statement from LeetCode:

> Given a string containing just the characters '(', ')', '{', '}', '[' and ']', determine if the input string is valid. An input string is valid if:
> 1. Open brackets must be closed by the same type of brackets.
> 2. Open brackets must be closed in the correct order.
> 3. Every close bracket has a corresponding open bracket of the same type.

For example:
- `"()"` is valid.
- `"()[]{}"` is valid.
- `"(]"` is not valid.
- `"([)]"` is not valid.
- `"{[]}"` is valid.

This problem is relevant because it tests your understanding of stacks—a key data structure for tracking order and pairing elements. In interviews, it's often used to assess how you approach problems that require matching or balancing, which are common in real-world applications like parsing code or validating expressions.

## ELI5: Understanding Valid Parentheses

Imagine you're organizing a set of toy boxes that come in pairs: round boxes (like `()`), square boxes (`[]`), and curly boxes (`{}`). Each box has a lid that must match it perfectly, and you can only close a box if it's the last one you opened. Your job is to check if a sequence of opening and closing boxes makes sense.

- If you open a round box `(` , you must close it with a `)` before closing any other box that was opened later.
- If you try to close a box with the wrong lid (like closing a round box with a square lid `]`), that's wrong.
- If you have lids left over without boxes to close, or boxes without lids, that's also wrong.

To solve this, you can keep a "stack" of opened boxes. Every time you open a box, you put it on top of the stack. When you close a box, you check if the top of the stack matches the lid. If it does, you remove the box from the stack. If it doesn't match, or if there's no box to close, it's invalid. At the end, if the stack is empty, everything matched perfectly!

## Solving Valid Parentheses with TypeScript

Let's implement a solution in TypeScript. We'll use a stack to keep track of opening brackets and ensure they match with closing brackets in the correct order. TypeScript's type system will help us define clear structures and avoid errors.

### Approach
1. Create a mapping of closing brackets to their corresponding opening brackets.
2. Use a stack (implemented as an array) to store opening brackets as we encounter them.
3. For each character in the string:
   - If it's an opening bracket, push it onto the stack.
   - If it's a closing bracket, check if the stack's top element matches it. If it does, pop the stack; if not, return false.
4. At the end, check if the stack is empty (all brackets matched).

### TypeScript Code Solution

Here's the complete solution with detailed comments:

```typescript
function isValid(s: string): boolean {
    // Define a mapping of closing brackets to opening brackets using a Map
    const bracketsMap = new Map<string, string>([
        [')', '('],
        ['}', '{'],
        [']', '[']
    ]);
    
    // Stack to store opening brackets
    const stack: string[] = [];
    
    // Iterate through each character in the input string
    for (const char of s) {
        // If the character is a closing bracket (exists as a key in the map)
        if (bracketsMap.has(char)) {
            // Check if stack is empty (no opening bracket to match) or
            // if the top of the stack doesn't match the expected opening bracket
            if (stack.length === 0 || stack[stack.length - 1] !== bracketsMap.get(char)) {
                return false;
            }
            // If it matches, pop the top opening bracket from the stack
            stack.pop();
        } else {
            // If it's an opening bracket, push it onto the stack
            stack.push(char);
        }
    }
    
    // Return true only if all brackets are matched (stack is empty)
    return stack.length === 0;
}

// Test cases to demonstrate the solution
console.log(isValid("()")); // true
console.log(isValid("()[]{}")); // true
console.log(isValid("(]")); // false
console.log(isValid("([)]")); // false
console.log(isValid("{[]}")); // true
```

### Explanation of the Code
- **Type Safety**: We use TypeScript's type annotations (`string` for input, `boolean` for output, and `string[]` for the stack) to ensure clarity and catch potential type errors early.
- **Map for Matching**: A `Map` stores the closing-to-opening bracket pairs, making lookups efficient and readable.
- **Stack Logic**: We use an array as a stack. For each closing bracket, we check the top of the stack. If it doesn't match or the stack is empty, the string is invalid.
- **Time and Space Complexity**:
  - Time Complexity: $O(n)$, where $n$ is the length of the input string, as we traverse the string once.
  - Space Complexity: $O(n)$ in the worst case, where the stack stores up to half the string (all opening brackets).

### Why Use TypeScript?
While this problem can be solved in any language, TypeScript adds value by:
- Ensuring the input is typed as `string`, preventing accidental non-string inputs.
- Making the code self-documenting with explicit types for the stack and return value.
- Allowing IDEs to provide better autocompletion and error checking, which is helpful during interviews if you're coding in a TypeScript-friendly environment.

## Additional Exercise: Extended Validation

Let's consider a slight variation of the problem as an additional exercise. Suppose we want to validate not just brackets but also other paired characters, like angle brackets `<` and `>`. Can we modify our solution to handle custom pairs?

### Solution to Extended Validation

Here's the modified TypeScript code to handle custom pairs:

```typescript
function isValidExtended(s: string, pairs: [string, string][]): boolean {
    // Create a map from closing to opening characters based on provided pairs
    const charMap = new Map<string, string>();
    for (const [open, close] of pairs) {
        charMap.set(close, open);
    }
    
    const stack: string[] = [];
    const openingChars = new Set(pairs.map(pair => pair[0]));
    
    for (const char of s) {
        if (charMap.has(char)) {
            if (stack.length === 0 || stack[stack.length - 1] !== charMap.get(char)) {
                return false;
            }
            stack.pop();
        } else if (openingChars.has(char)) {
            stack.push(char);
        } else {
            // Ignore characters not in the pairs
            continue;
        }
    }
    
    return stack.length === 0;
}

// Test cases for extended validation
const bracketPairs: [string, string][] = [['(', ')'], ['{', '}'], ['[', ']'], ['<', '>']];
console.log(isValidExtended("()<>", bracketPairs)); // true
console.log(isValidExtended("(<>)", bracketPairs)); // true
console.log(isValidExtended("(<)", bracketPairs)); // false
console.log(isValidExtended("abc()def", bracketPairs)); // true (ignores non-paired chars)
```

### Explanation of Extended Solution
- **Custom Pairs**: We accept an array of tuples defining opening and closing pairs, making the function reusable for different sets of characters.
- **Set for Opening Chars**: A `Set` quickly checks if a character is an opening character from the provided pairs.
- **Flexibility**: Non-paired characters are ignored, simulating real-world parsing where irrelevant data might be present.

This variation shows how the core stack-based approach can be generalized, a useful skill in interviews where follow-up questions often test adaptability.

## Conclusion

In this blog post, we've tackled the **Valid Parentheses** problem from LeetCode using TypeScript. We explored how to use a stack to validate bracket sequences, ensuring that brackets are properly matched and closed in the correct order. Key takeaways include:
- The importance of stacks for tracking order in problems involving pairing or nesting.
- How TypeScript's type system adds clarity and safety to our code, even for simple problems.
- A time complexity of $O(n)$ and space complexity of $O(n)$, which are critical to discuss in interviews.
- An extended exercise showing how to generalize the solution for custom character pairs, demonstrating adaptability.

This problem is a staple in technical interviews, especially at companies like Apple, because it tests fundamental concepts like stack usage and string parsing in a concise way. By solving it in TypeScript, we've also highlighted how modern JavaScript practices can enhance code quality. In the next post, we'll move on to another easy problem to build on these skills. Stay tuned, and happy coding!
