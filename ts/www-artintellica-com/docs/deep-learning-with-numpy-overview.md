Below, I provide a detailed breakdown of the "Learn Deep Learning with NumPy" course, dividing each of the four modules into multiple "chapters" (or blog posts) that will be published as separate posts on a website. Each chapter includes relevant math and code, designed to progressively build toward deep learning by implementing and reusing fundamental elements, such as gradient descent, to ensure a comprehensive understanding of small-scale deep learning models feasible on your MacBook Pro’s CPU. The chapters are structured to be educational, incremental, and practical, aligning with your goal of coding core components like gradient descent, backpropagation, and convolutional layers, as discussed previously. Each blog post description includes the math concepts covered, the code you’ll write, and how it contributes to the deep learning journey.

### Course Breakdown: Learn Deep Learning with NumPy

The course consists of four modules, each broken into 3-5 chapters (blog posts). Each chapter builds on the previous one, reusing functions (e.g., `gradient_descent()`, `relu()`) to create a modular library, culminating in deep learning models like MLPs and simple CNNs for MNIST, with training times of ~2-15 min/epoch on your CPU.
