i need your help to write a series of blog posts on influential machine learning
papers. the primary purpose is to understand the contents of the papers for
someone new to machine learning. we will both understand the math and also
create coding exersizes that use python, pytorch, numpy, and matplotlib, etc.,
wherever possible, to understand the math and concepts in the papers.

the papers are divided into two eras: before the transformer, and after the
transformer.

for each blog post, whenever using math, please use dollar-delimited math, like
$y=Xw+b$, or,

$$
y = Xw + b
$$,
i.e., use double dollar signs for equations that are on their own line.

currently, we are on the pre-transformer era. can you please write a blog post
about this paper?

1. **"A Fast Learning Algorithm for Deep Belief Nets" (2006) - Hinton et al.**
   - Introduced deep belief networks, enabling efficient training of deep neural
     networks using unsupervised pre-training, kickstarting the deep learning
     revival.
