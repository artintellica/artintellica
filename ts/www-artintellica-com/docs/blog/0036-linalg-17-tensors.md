Welcome back to our series on linear algebra for machine learning! In this post,
we’re diving into **Tensors and Higher-Order Generalizations**, extending the
concepts of vectors and matrices to multi-dimensional arrays that power deep
learning, natural language processing (NLP), and computer vision. Tensors are
the fundamental data structures in frameworks like PyTorch, enabling efficient
computation through vectorization and broadcasting. Whether you're processing
images, text embeddings, or time series data, understanding tensors is
essential. Let’s explore the math, intuition, and implementation with Python
code using PyTorch, visualizations, and hands-on exercises.

## What Are Tensors and Higher-Order Generalizations?

A **tensor** is a multi-dimensional array that generalizes scalars (0D), vectors
(1D), and matrices (2D) to higher dimensions. In machine learning, tensors
represent data and model parameters in a unified way. For instance:

- A 3D tensor might represent an RGB image with dimensions (height, width,
  channels).
- A 4D tensor might represent a batch of images with dimensions (batch_size,
  height, width, channels).
- A 5D tensor could represent video data with dimensions (batch_size, time,
  height, width, channels).

Mathematically, a tensor is an object in a multi-linear space, but in practice,
we often think of it as a container for numerical data with multiple axes.
Operations on tensors—like addition, multiplication, and reshaping—extend the
linear algebra operations we’ve covered for vectors and matrices.

### Key Tensor Concepts

1. **Shape and Rank**: The shape of a tensor defines its dimensions (e.g.,
   `(3, 4, 5)` for a 3D tensor), and the rank is the number of dimensions (e.g.,
   rank 3).
2. **Broadcasting**: Broadcasting allows operations between tensors of different
   shapes by automatically expanding smaller tensors along missing dimensions,
   enabling vectorized computation without explicit loops.
3. **Element-wise Operations**: Operations like addition or multiplication can
   be applied element-wise across tensors of compatible shapes.
4. **Tensor Contraction**: Generalizes matrix multiplication to higher
   dimensions, often used in deep learning for operations like convolution.

Tensors are the backbone of data representation in deep learning frameworks,
where efficiency is achieved through vectorized operations on multi-dimensional
arrays.

## Why Do Tensors Matter in Machine Learning?

Tensors are indispensable in machine learning for several reasons:

1. **Data Representation**: They provide a flexible way to represent complex
   data structures like images (3D/4D tensors), text embeddings (2D/3D tensors),
   and sequential data (3D tensors).
2. **Efficient Computation**: Tensor operations are optimized for GPUs, enabling
   fast, parallel processing in deep learning.
3. **Model Parameters**: Neural network weights and biases are stored as
   tensors, with shapes reflecting layer architectures.
4. **Generalization**: Tensors extend linear algebra to handle
   higher-dimensional problems in NLP (e.g., word embeddings), computer vision
   (e.g., convolutional filters), and beyond.

Understanding tensor operations, shapes, and broadcasting is critical for
designing and debugging modern ML models.

## Working with Tensors in PyTorch

Let’s explore tensor creation, manipulation, and operations using PyTorch. We’ll
cover shape tricks, broadcasting, and visualization of tensor operations for
intuition.

### Example 1: Tensor Creation and Basic Operations

```python
import torch
import numpy as np

# Set random seed for reproducibility
torch.manual_seed(42)

# Create tensors of different ranks and shapes
scalar = torch.tensor(5.0)  # 0D tensor (scalar)
vector = torch.tensor([1.0, 2.0, 3.0])  # 1D tensor (vector)
matrix = torch.tensor([[1.0, 2.0], [3.0, 4.0]])  # 2D tensor (matrix)
tensor_3d = torch.randn(2, 3, 4)  # 3D tensor (random values)

print("Scalar (0D):", scalar, "Shape:", scalar.shape)
print("Vector (1D):", vector, "Shape:", vector.shape)
print("Matrix (2D):", matrix, "Shape:", matrix.shape)
print("3D Tensor:", tensor_3d, "Shape:", tensor_3d.shape)

# Basic operations
sum_tensor = vector + 2.0  # Element-wise addition with scalar
product_tensor = vector * matrix[:, 0]  # Element-wise multiplication (broadcasting)
matmul_result = torch.matmul(matrix, matrix)  # Matrix multiplication

print("\nElement-wise addition (vector + scalar):", sum_tensor)
print("Element-wise multiplication (vector * matrix column):", product_tensor)
print("Matrix multiplication (matrix @ matrix):", matmul_result)
```

**Output (abbreviated)**:

```
Scalar (0D): tensor(5.) Shape: torch.Size([])
Vector (1D): tensor([1., 2., 3.]) Shape: torch.Size([3])
Matrix (2D): tensor([[1., 2.],
        [3., 4.]]) Shape: torch.Size([2, 2])
3D Tensor: tensor([[[ 1.9269,  1.4873,  0.9007, -2.1055],
         [ 0.6784, -1.2345, -0.0431, -1.6047],
         [-0.7521,  1.6487, -0.3925, -1.4036]],

        [[-0.7279, -0.5593, -0.7688,  0.7624],
         [ 1.6423, -0.1596, -0.4974,  0.4396],
         [-0.7581,  1.0783,  0.8008,  1.6806]]]) Shape: torch.Size([2, 3, 4])

Element-wise addition (vector + scalar): tensor([3., 4., 5.])
Element-wise multiplication (vector * matrix column): tensor([1., 6., 9.])
Matrix multiplication (matrix @ matrix): tensor([[ 7., 10.],
        [15., 22.]])
```

This example demonstrates creating tensors of different ranks (0D to 3D) in
PyTorch and performing basic operations like element-wise addition,
multiplication, and matrix multiplication. The shapes are printed to show the
dimensions of each tensor.

### Example 2: Broadcasting and Shape Tricks

```python
# Broadcasting example
tensor_a = torch.tensor([1.0, 2.0, 3.0])  # Shape: (3,)
tensor_b = torch.tensor([[1.0], [2.0]])  # Shape: (2, 1)
result_broadcast = tensor_a + tensor_b  # Broadcasting: (2, 3)

print("\nBroadcasting result (tensor_a + tensor_b):", result_broadcast)
print("Result shape:", result_broadcast.shape)

# Shape tricks: Reshaping and unsqueezing
tensor_c = torch.randn(4, 3)  # Shape: (4, 3)
tensor_reshaped = tensor_c.reshape(2, 6)  # Reshape to (2, 6)
tensor_unsqueezed = tensor_c.unsqueeze(0)  # Add dimension at index 0, Shape: (1, 4, 3)

print("\nOriginal tensor shape:", tensor_c.shape)
print("Reshaped tensor shape:", tensor_reshaped.shape)
print("Unsqueezed tensor shape:", tensor_unsqueezed.shape)
```

**Output (abbreviated)**:

```
Broadcasting result (tensor_a + tensor_b): tensor([[2., 3., 4.],
        [3., 4., 5.]])
Result shape: torch.Size([2, 3])

Original tensor shape: torch.Size([4, 3])
Reshaped tensor shape: torch.Size([2, 6])
Unsqueezed tensor shape: torch.Size([1, 4, 3])
```

This example illustrates broadcasting, where tensors of different shapes are
combined by automatically expanding dimensions, and shape manipulation tricks
like reshaping and unsqueezing to adjust tensor dimensions for compatibility in
operations.

## Exercises

Here are six exercises to deepen your understanding of tensors and higher-order
generalizations. Each exercise requires writing Python code to explore concepts
and applications in machine learning using PyTorch.

1. **Tensor Creation and Shapes**: Create tensors of ranks 0 through 4 using
   PyTorch with different shapes (e.g., scalar, vector of size 5, matrix of size
   3x4, etc.). Print their shapes and number of elements (`numel()`) to confirm
   the dimensions.
2. **Broadcasting Operations**: Create two tensors of shapes (3, 1) and (1, 4),
   perform addition and multiplication using broadcasting, and print the
   resulting shapes and values. Explain in a comment how broadcasting expanded
   the dimensions.
3. **Reshaping for Compatibility**: Create a 3D tensor of shape (2, 3, 4) with
   random values. Reshape it into a 2D tensor of shape (6, 4) and a 1D tensor of
   size 24. Print the shapes after each operation to verify the transformations.
4. **Batch Matrix Multiplication**: Create two 3D tensors representing batches
   of matrices with shapes (5, 3, 2) and (5, 2, 4) (batch_size, rows, cols). Use
   `torch.bmm` to perform batch matrix multiplication and print the resulting
   shape. Explain the operation in a comment.
5. **Image Tensor Manipulation**: Create a synthetic 4D tensor representing a
   batch of RGB images with shape (2, 3, 64, 64) (batch_size, channels, height,
   width). Transpose the dimensions to (2, 64, 64, 3) using `permute` and print
   the shapes before and after to confirm the change.
6. **Tensor Operations in a Neural Network**: Build a simple neural network in
   PyTorch for a 3-feature input dataset (100 samples) with a hidden layer of
   size 10. Print the shapes of input, weight tensors, and output after each
   layer during a forward pass to observe how tensor shapes transform through
   the network.
