- the course is called "Learn the Training Loop with PyTorch"
- always provide a brief introduction to the topic at hand
- then always provide a very simple "ELI5" explanation of the topic, that theortically anyone could understand
- then provide the mathematical foundations. for math, always use dollar delimited LaTeX, and always provide a brief explanation of the math. for instance, $\mathbf{y} = \mathbf{X}\mathbf{w} + \mathbf{b}$ is the equation for linear regression, where $\mathbf{y}$ is the output vector, $\mathbf{X}$ is the input matrix, $\mathbf{w}$ is the weight vector, and $\mathbf{b}$ is the bias vector.

  $$
  \mathbf{y} = \mathbf{X}\mathbf{w} + \mathbf{b}
  $$

- for other formatting, use markdown like headings, bullet points, and code blocks to make the content readable. do not use HTML tags.
- after the math is complete, then provide one or more demonstrations of the topic using PyTorch. if possible, always use PyTorch, not numpy, just to keep it simple and consistent. you can also use matplotlib to visualize the results.
- for all python code, always use type hints, and, if necessary, describe installation instructions using "uv" (not pip).
- then, create a series of exercises, somewhere from 1 - 4 total exercises that cover the material. please provide the soruce code for each exercise to make sure the student can easily compare their solution to the correct answer. do not hide the exercises and do not put HTML in the exercises.

# Learn the Training Loop with PyTorch  
## Module 2.5: Mini-batching and Data Pipelines

---

### Introduction

Welcome back to "Learn the Training Loop with PyTorch"! In our journey so far, we've built and trained neural networks using simple loops and small datasets. But what happens when we need to scale up to real-world data? How do modern deep learning workflows make training efficient and stable?

**Today's post is about one of the most important ingredients in practical machine learning: mini-batching and data pipelines.** We'll see why batching helps, what it looks like mathematically, and how you can use PyTorch's powerful dataloaders to manage your data efficiently.

---

## ELI5: What is Mini-batching?

**Imagine you’re learning a new skill by solving math problems.** If you only look at one problem at a time (stochastic learning), you might get confused by noisy mistakes in each single example. If you wait until you can review *all* the problems ever (full batch learning), it takes forever to learn anything. Mini-batching is like gathering a small group of problems at a time, learning from their *average* mistake, and then updating your strategy before picking a new group.

In machine learning, we call these small groups "**mini-batches**." By processing mini-batches, models learn faster and more robustly, while also making better use of hardware like GPUs.

---

## Mathematical Foundations

Let’s formalize what happens during mini-batch training.

Suppose our dataset consists of $N$ examples:  
$$
\{ (\mathbf{x}_i, y_i) \}_{i=1}^{N}
$$  
where $\mathbf{x}_i$ is the input and $y_i$ is the target.

In **batch gradient descent**, we compute the loss over the full dataset:
$$
\mathcal{L}_{\text{batch}} = \frac{1}{N} \sum_{i=1}^{N} \ell(f(\mathbf{x}_i; \theta), y_i)
$$
- Here, $f$ is our model with parameters $\theta$
- $\ell$ is the loss function (e.g., MSE, cross-entropy)

In **stochastic gradient descent (SGD)**, we use just one example at a time:
$$
\mathcal{L}_{\text{SGD}} = \ell(f(\mathbf{x}_j; \theta), y_j)
$$
for a randomly sampled $j$.

**Mini-batch gradient descent** is the compromise:
- Sample a batch $B$ of $m$ examples ($m \ll N$)
- Compute the average loss on just this batch:
$$
\mathcal{L}_{\text{batch}} = \frac{1}{m} \sum_{i \in B} \ell(f(\mathbf{x}_i; \theta), y_i)
$$

**Key points:**
- Mini-batching gives a more reliable estimate of the "true" loss gradient than a single sample
- It's much faster per update than processing the full dataset at once

---

## In-depth Explanation

Let’s expand on why mini-batching is so widely used.

### Why not always use the whole dataset?

- **Full batch updates (batch gradient descent):**
  - Pros: Exact gradient, smooth convergence
  - Cons: *Very* slow, especially with large datasets

### Why not always use single examples?

- **Single sample updates (stochastic gradient descent):**
  - Pros: Fast updates, can escape bad local optima due to noise
  - Cons: Very noisy updates, training can “zig-zag” and be unstable

### The Goldilocks Solution: Mini-batching

Mini-batches (typically 8–1024 samples per batch) give the best of both worlds:
- **Stability**: Averaging over a batch reduces noise in each update
- **Efficiency**: Vectorized operations allow hardware (CPUs/GPUs/TPUs) to work efficiently
- **Generalization**: Some stochasticity remains, which can help the model not get stuck in bad solutions

### Data Pipelines

When we train on large datasets, it’s not just about the math—it’s about *moving data quickly* from disk to memory to GPU. That’s where **data pipelines** come in.

PyTorch provides:
- **Datasets** (how to get one sample)
- **DataLoaders** (how to batch samples and shuffle at random)
- Tools to stack and process samples efficiently, automatically feeding your model batch after batch during training.

## Demonstration: Mini-batching with PyTorch

Let's see mini-batching and dataloaders in action! We’ll build a simple dataset and visualize the difference between single-sample updates and batching.

### Installation

If you haven’t installed PyTorch or matplotlib, run:

```bash
uv pip install torch matplotlib
```

### 1. Simple Dataset and Dataloader

```python
from typing import Tuple
import torch
from torch.utils.data import Dataset, DataLoader
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Create a simple regression dataset
class ToyDataset(Dataset):
    def __init__(self, n_samples: int = 100):
        self.x = torch.linspace(-2, 2, n_samples).unsqueeze(1)
        self.y = 3 * self.x + 1 + 0.5 * torch.randn_like(self.x)  # Linear + noise

    def __len__(self) -> int:
        return len(self.x)

    def __getitem__(self, idx: int) -> Tuple[torch.Tensor, torch.Tensor]:
        return self.x[idx], self.y[idx]

# Create the dataset and dataloaders
dataset = ToyDataset()
batch_size = 16

loader_batch = DataLoader(dataset, batch_size=batch_size, shuffle=True)
loader_single = DataLoader(dataset, batch_size=1, shuffle=True)
```

---

### 2. Training: Batching vs. Stochastic

We’ll set up a very simple linear model, and compare two training schemes:
- “SGD” (single sample)
- “Mini-batch” (batch size >1)

```python
import torch.nn as nn

def train(
    loader: DataLoader, 
    model: nn.Module, 
    lr: float = 0.1, 
    epochs: int = 20
) -> list:
    optimizer = torch.optim.SGD(model.parameters(), lr=lr)
    criterion = nn.MSELoss()
    losses = []
    for epoch in range(epochs):
        batch_losses = []
        for xb, yb in loader:
            pred = model(xb)
            loss = criterion(pred, yb)
            optimizer.zero_grad()
            loss.backward()
            optimizer.step()
            batch_losses.append(loss.item())
        losses.append(sum(batch_losses) / len(batch_losses))
    return losses

# Models
model_single = nn.Linear(1, 1)
model_batch = nn.Linear(1, 1)

# Train
losses_single = train(loader_single, model_single)
losses_batch = train(loader_batch, model_batch)

# Plot
plt.plot(losses_single, label='Batch size = 1 (SGD)')
plt.plot(losses_batch, label='Batch size = 16')
plt.xlabel('Epoch')
plt.ylabel('Loss')
plt.legend()
plt.title('Training Loss: Single Sample vs. Mini-batch')
plt.show()
```

**What you should see:**  
- The batch training curve is smoother and typically converges faster. The single-sample curve is bumpier, showing more noise.

### 3. Data Pipeline: Custom Transformations and GPU Support

With PyTorch, you can extend this pipeline to include all kinds of preprocessing—normalization, data augmentation, and (if you have one!) transfer data to a GPU for even more speed.

> Try putting `.to("cuda")` on your tensors if you have a GPU!

## Exercises

---

### Exercise 1: Experiment with Batch Sizes

**Task:** Modify the code to compare training with different batch sizes (e.g., 1, 8, 32, 64). Plot all the loss curves together.

```python
batch_sizes = [1, 8, 32, 64]
losses_all = []

for b in batch_sizes:
    loader = DataLoader(dataset, batch_size=b, shuffle=True)
    model = nn.Linear(1, 1)
    losses = train(loader, model)
    losses_all.append(losses)

for i, losses in enumerate(losses_all):
    plt.plot(losses, label=f'Batch size = {batch_sizes[i]}')
plt.xlabel('Epoch')
plt.ylabel('Loss')
plt.legend()
plt.title('Effect of Batch Size on Training Loss')
plt.show()
```

---

### Exercise 2: Custom Data Pipeline

**Task:** Implement a simple transformation that standardizes (zero-mean, unit std) the features in the dataset.

```python
from torch.utils.data import Dataset

class StandardizedToyDataset(Dataset):
    def __init__(self, n_samples: int = 100):
        self.x = torch.linspace(-2, 2, n_samples).unsqueeze(1)
        self.y = 3 * self.x + 1 + 0.5 * torch.randn_like(self.x)
        # Standardize features
        self.x_mean = self.x.mean()
        self.x_std = self.x.std()
        self.x = (self.x - self.x_mean) / self.x_std

    def __len__(self) -> int:
        return len(self.x)

    def __getitem__(self, idx: int) -> Tuple[torch.Tensor, torch.Tensor]:
        return self.x[idx], self.y[idx]
```

---

### Exercise 3: DataLoader for Real Datasets

**Task:** Use `torchvision`’s built-in datasets (e.g., MNIST or CIFAR10) to create a data pipeline and visualize a sample batch.

```python
import torchvision
from torchvision import transforms

transform = transforms.Compose([
    transforms.ToTensor(),
    transforms.Normalize((0.5,), (0.5,)) # for grayscale images like MNIST
])

mnist_train = torchvision.datasets.MNIST(root='./data', train=True, download=True, transform=transform)
loader = DataLoader(mnist_train, batch_size=32, shuffle=True)

# Visualize a batch
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

images, labels = next(iter(loader))
plt.figure(figsize=(8, 4))
for i in range(8):
    plt.subplot(2, 4, i+1)
    plt.imshow(images[i][0], cmap='gray')
    plt.title(f"Label: {labels[i].item()}")
    plt.axis('off')
plt.tight_layout()
plt.show()
```

## Summary

In this post, we've covered the essential concept of mini-batching in deep learning, and how PyTorch's data pipeline tools make it easy to implement. Rather than updating your model on just a single example at a time, mini-batching lets you leverage parallel hardware and more stable learning dynamics. You've also seen how to quickly set up both synthetic and real data pipelines in PyTorch.
