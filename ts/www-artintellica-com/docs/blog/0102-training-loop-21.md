# Learn the Training Loop with PyTorch  
## Module 2.1 – From Linear to Nonlinear: Why Neural Networks?

---

### Introduction

Welcome back to our series, "Learn the Training Loop with PyTorch"! In Module 1, we learned how simple models like linear regression learn from data. Now we're taking the next leap: from linear models to the world of neural networks. But *why* do we need neural networks? What makes them special? In this post, we’ll explore the motivation, introduce the basic architecture (multi-layer perceptron, or MLP), and demystify one of the key reasons neural networks work: **activation functions**.

---

## ELI5: Why Neural Networks?

Imagine you have a toy with wheels. You can push it in a straight line (that's what a linear model does—it finds straight-line patterns in data). But what if you want your toy to turn corners, loop around, or follow a complex path? That’s where neural networks come in! 

**Neural networks** are like supercharged toys that can twist, turn, and wiggle their way through complicated patterns. They can learn not just straight lines, but curves, zig-zags, and all sorts of shapes. At the heart of this ability are *hidden layers* and special *activation functions*—think of them as clever bends and joints you add to your toy so it can flex and move in new ways.

---

## Mathematical Foundations

### The Limitation of Linear Models

Recall the linear regression model:

$$
\mathbf{y} = \mathbf{X}\mathbf{w} + \mathbf{b}
$$

- $\mathbf{y}$ is the output vector,
- $\mathbf{X}$ is the input data matrix,
- $\mathbf{w}$ is the weights vector,
- $\mathbf{b}$ is the bias vector.

**Limitation:** This setup only learns straight-line relationships between input and output.

### Neural Networks: Adding Layers

A *neural network* (specifically, a feedforward neural network or multi-layer perceptron, MLP) adds one or more **hidden layers** between input and output.

The simplest MLP with one hidden layer looks like this:

$$
\mathbf{h} = f(\mathbf{X}\mathbf{W}_1 + \mathbf{b}_1)
$$

$$
\mathbf{\hat{y}} = \mathbf{h}\mathbf{W}_2 + \mathbf{b}_2
$$

- $\mathbf{W}_1$ and $\mathbf{b}_1$: weights and biases for the *hidden layer*,
- $f(\cdot)$: **activation function** (e.g., ReLU, sigmoid, tanh),
- $\mathbf{h}$: hidden layer activations,
- $\mathbf{W}_2$ and $\mathbf{b}_2$: weights and biases for the *output layer*.

More generally, for $L$ layers:

$$
\mathbf{h}_0 = \mathbf{X}
$$

$$
\mathbf{h}_l = f(\mathbf{h}_{l-1}\mathbf{W}_l + \mathbf{b}_l), \quad \text{for } l=1 \ldots L-1
$$

$$
\mathbf{\hat{y}} = \mathbf{h}_{L-1}\mathbf{W}_L + \mathbf{b}_L
$$

#### Activation Functions

The *activation function* introduces nonlinearity; without it, stacking layers is no better than a single linear layer. The most common activation functions are:

- **ReLU (Rectified Linear Unit):**
  $$
  \text{ReLU}(x) = \max(0, x)
  $$
- **Sigmoid:**
  $$
  \sigma(x) = \frac{1}{1 + e^{-x}}
  $$
- **Tanh:**
  $$
  \tanh(x) = \frac{e^{x} - e^{-x}}{e^{x} + e^{-x}}
  $$

These allow the network to bend and shape data in ways linear models cannot.

---

## In-Depth Explanation

### Why Do We Need Nonlinear Models?

**Linear models** can only learn relationships like “if variable X goes up, variable Y goes up (or down) by a fixed amount.” However, most interesting patterns in the real world are messy: for example, predicting house prices, recognizing objects in photos, or streaming speech into text. These relationships are *nonlinear* (they don’t look like a straight line).

A **neural network** with *hidden layers* and *nonlinear activation functions* can learn *decision boundaries* and patterns that are wavy, irregular, and complex.

#### The Secret Ingredient: Hidden Layers + Activation Functions

- **Hidden Layers:** Imagine these as workbenches, each transforming your inputs in a different way.
- **Activation Functions:** Like switches or filters that decide "should this signal pass through, and if so, how much should I squish or stretch it?"

**Without activation functions**, stacking linear layers just results in another big linear transformation—a waste! It's the nonlinear activations that let neural networks become super-flexible.

### Common Activation Functions

Let’s quickly summarize three popular ones:

- **ReLU:** Fast, simple, and effective. Kills negative values (sets them to 0), lets positives pass through. Helps with vanishing gradient issues.
- **Sigmoid:** Squashes values between 0 and 1. Nice for probabilities but can suffer from vanishing gradients with big networks.
- **Tanh:** Like sigmoid, but squashes between -1 and 1. Zero-centered, but still can have vanishing gradients.

---

## Demonstration: PyTorch Implementation

Let's see how to implement (and visualize) a simple MLP in PyTorch that can fit data that a linear model *cannot*.

We'll:
- Create a simple dataset (a curved, moon-shaped pattern).
- Fit with a linear model (fails to capture nonlinearity).
- Fit with a single hidden-layer MLP (success!).

### Installation with **uv**

If you don't have PyTorch and matplotlib yet, install them:
```bash
uv pip install torch matplotlib scikit-learn
```

### Step 1: Generate Nonlinear Data

```python
from typing import Tuple
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
from sklearn.datasets import make_moons
import torch

def generate_moons(n_samples: int = 200, noise: float = 0.20) -> Tuple[torch.Tensor, torch.Tensor]:
    X_np, y_np = make_moons(n_samples=n_samples, noise=noise, random_state=42)
    X = torch.tensor(X_np, dtype=torch.float32)
    y = torch.tensor(y_np, dtype=torch.float32).unsqueeze(1)
    return X, y

X, y = generate_moons()
plt.scatter(X[:, 0], X[:, 1], c=y.squeeze(), cmap="coolwarm", s=40)
plt.title("Synthetic Nonlinear Dataset: Two Moons")
plt.xlabel("x1")
plt.ylabel("x2")
plt.show()
```

---

### Step 2: Fit a Linear Model

```python
import torch.nn as nn

class LinearModel(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, input_dim: int, output_dim: int) -> None:
        super().__init__()
        self.fc = nn.Linear(input_dim, output_dim)

    def forward(self, x: torch.Tensor) -> torch.Tensor:
        return torch.sigmoid(self.fc(x))  # For binary classification

model = LinearModel(input_dim=2, output_dim=1)
loss_fn = nn.BCELoss()
optimizer = torch.optim.SGD(model.parameters(), lr=0.1)

# Training loop (very simple!)
for epoch in range(1000):
    optimizer.zero_grad()
    y_pred = model(X)
    loss = loss_fn(y_pred, y)
    loss.backward()
    optimizer.step()

print(f"Final training loss: {loss.item():.4f}")
```

#### Visualize Linear Model Decision Boundary

```python
import numpy as np

def plot_decision_boundary(model: nn.Module, X: torch.Tensor, y: torch.Tensor) -> None:
    x_min, x_max = X[:,0].min() - 0.5, X[:,0].max() + 0.5
    y_min, y_max = X[:,1].min() - 0.5, X[:,1].max() + 0.5
    xx, yy = np.meshgrid(np.linspace(x_min, x_max, 200), 
                         np.linspace(y_min, y_max, 200))
    grid = torch.tensor(np.c_[xx.ravel(), yy.ravel()], dtype=torch.float32)
    with torch.no_grad():
        probs = model(grid).reshape(xx.shape)
    plt.contourf(xx, yy, probs, alpha=0.3, cmap="coolwarm")
    plt.scatter(X[:,0], X[:,1], c=y.squeeze(), cmap="coolwarm", s=40)
    plt.title("Linear Model: Can't Capture Nonlinearity")
    plt.show()

plot_decision_boundary(model, X, y)
```

---

### Step 3: Fit an MLP (Neural Network) with Activation Function

```python
class MLP(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, input_dim: int, hidden_dim: int, output_dim: int) -> None:
        super().__init__()
        self.fc1 = nn.Linear(input_dim, hidden_dim)
        self.act = nn.ReLU()  # Try swapping to nn.Tanh() or nn.Sigmoid()
        self.fc2 = nn.Linear(hidden_dim, output_dim)
        
    def forward(self, x: torch.Tensor) -> torch.Tensor:
        h = self.act(self.fc1(x))
        return torch.sigmoid(self.fc2(h))  # For binary classification

mlp = MLP(input_dim=2, hidden_dim=8, output_dim=1)
optimizer = torch.optim.Adam(mlp.parameters(), lr=0.05)
loss_fn = nn.BCELoss()

# Training loop
for epoch in range(1000):
    optimizer.zero_grad()
    y_pred = mlp(X)
    loss = loss_fn(y_pred, y)
    loss.backward()
    optimizer.step()

print(f"Final training loss: {loss.item():.4f}")
plot_decision_boundary(mlp, X, y)
```

You should now see that the neural network successfully **separates the two moons**, learning a complex, nonlinear boundary—something a linear model simply cannot do.

---

## Exercises

1. **Try Different Activation Functions**  
Edit the `MLP` class above and replace `nn.ReLU()` with `nn.Tanh()` and then `nn.Sigmoid()`. Retrain the model each time and visualize the boundary. What changes?

```python
# Swap activation function in the MLP class:
# self.act = nn.Tanh()
# or
# self.act = nn.Sigmoid()
```

2. **Add More Hidden Neurons**  
Increase the number of hidden units from 8 to 32. Does the model fit the data better or worse? Try this in the `MLP` class:

```python
mlp = MLP(input_dim=2, hidden_dim=32, output_dim=1)
```

3. **Fit Using Only a Linear Model**  
Try removing the activation function and hidden layer from the MLP, so it’s just a single `Linear` layer. Confirm that it can't fit the nonlinear data.

```python
class SimpleLinear(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, input_dim: int, output_dim: int) -> None:
        super().__init__()
        self.fc = nn.Linear(input_dim, output_dim)

    def forward(self, x: torch.Tensor) -> torch.Tensor:
        return torch.sigmoid(self.fc(x))

model = SimpleLinear(2, 1)
```

## Summary

In this post, you learned:

- **Why neural networks?** Linear models are limited to straight-line relationships; neural nets unlock the power to fit much more complex data.
- **How do neural networks work?** By stacking layers and introducing activation functions, we unlock nonlinearity and flexibility.
- **What are activation functions?** Essential nonlinearities such as ReLU, sigmoid, and tanh, each with their own properties.
- **How to build and train an MLP in PyTorch?** With just a few lines, we went from linear to nonlinear and watched our model learn!

---

### Key Takeaways

- **Neural networks extend linear models** by stacking layers and using activation functions to model complex patterns.
- **Activation functions are crucial**; without them, your network can’t learn nonlinearities.
- **PyTorch makes it easy** to define, train, and experiment with different architectures.
- **Practice by experimenting**: Try changing activation functions, adding more layers or neurons, and visualizing how your model learns!

In the next lesson, we'll dig deeper into **forward and backward passes**—the gears that power neural network training. Stay tuned!

**USER:**

is there a way to make a neural network that can learn any function, no matter how complex? or do we need different numbers of layers and different architectures for different functions?

**ASSISTANT:**

Great question! This touches on a core concept in neural networks called the **Universal Approximation Theorem**—and a lot of the *practical* realities of modern deep learning.

---

## ELI5:  
A neural network, if it’s big enough (with enough neurons and the right activation functions), **can in *theory* learn any function**, no matter how squiggly or complex that function is! Imagine you had a magical Lego set: with enough blocks, you could build any shape—*but* if your blocks are too big or you don’t have the right connectors, you might have a hard time building something really detailed.

---

## Mathematical/Practical Explanation

### Universal Approximation Theorem

The **Universal Approximation Theorem** says that:
- A neural network with just a *single hidden layer* but enough neurons (and a nonlinear activation like sigmoid, tanh, or ReLU) can approximate **any continuous function** on a closed interval, as closely as we want.

In math terms:  
If $f$ is any continuous function, and your neural net is big enough,
$$
\text{MLP}(x) \approx f(x)
$$
for all $x$ in your domain.  

**BUT:**
- "Big enough" often means *unrealistically* large—far more neurons than you can realistically train or use.
- You might need a lot of training data, and training such huge nets is tricky.

### Depth vs. Width

- **Really wide (shallow) networks:** A single-layer network may theoretically fit anything, but needs immense numbers of neurons.
- **Deeper (narrower) networks:** Multiple hidden layers can learn complex functions with **fewer neurons overall**, and this tends to work much better in practice. That’s why most state-of-the-art neural networks have *many* layers (sometimes hundreds!).

### Architectures Matter for Certain Data

- While plain MLPs can fit any continuous function, specialized network *architectures* are much more efficient for certain problems:
  - **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs):** for images.
  - **Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs):** for sequences.
  - **Transformers:** for language or long-range interactions.

These architectures are designed to take advantage of patterns and structures (like the fact that nearby pixels in images matter) that a plain MLP can’t “see” as easily.

---

## Summary

- **Theoretically:** Yes—given enough neurons and the right nonlinearities, a neural net can learn *any* function (the Universal Approximation Theorem).
- **Practically:** We almost always need *multiple layers* (deep nets). The required size and architecture *depends on the function/data*:
  - Very complex functions often need deep or specialized architectures for efficiency, training stability, and effective generalization.
- **Choosing architecture:** In practice, we choose the number of layers and type of architecture based on the problem (images, language, tabular data, etc.), for best results.

---

**TL;DR:**  
Neural networks are universal function fitters—*in theory*. In practice, depth, size, and architecture matter for learning real-world complex functions!

**USER:**

if just one hidden layer can learn any continuous function, why do we need deep networks with many layers? can't we just use a single layer with enough neurons?

**ASSISTANT:**

Fantastic question! This confusion is **very common**—let’s clear it up:

---

## ELI5

Imagine you want to build a super-detailed Lego sculpture. You *could* use millions of tiny blocks in a single layer to copy every contour. But what if, instead, you built it in stages—with blocks forming big shapes, then smaller shapes, then details? You’d need *far* fewer blocks and it would be easier, too!

That’s why we build “deep” (many-layered) networks: they learn in **stages**—from simple to complex patterns—making them much more efficient.

---

## Mathematical/Practical Explanation

### Universal Approximation (But At What Cost?)

The **Universal Approximation Theorem** tells us a neural network with **one hidden layer** can approximate any continuous function—**if** it has *enough* hidden units (neurons).

But in practice:

- To fit really complicated real-world functions, a shallow network might require **a gigantic number of neurons**—possibly millions or billions!
- This leads to:
  - **Huge computational costs** (slow, massive parameter count)
  - **Difficulty training** (optimization gets harder as the network gets wider)
  - **Overfitting** (so many free parameters can just memorize data instead of learning to generalize)

### Why Deep Networks Are Better

Modern deep learning research shows that **deep networks** (many hidden layers, each with manageable width):

- Can represent complex functions using **far fewer neurons** (parameters) than shallow/wide networks.
- Learn **hierarchies of features**:
  - Early layers might learn simple edges or patterns,
  - Middle layers combine those into shapes,
  - Deeper layers combine shapes into complex concepts!
- Are ***much more efficient*** in practice—leading to powerful models like those for language (GPT), vision (ResNet, EfficientNet), and more.

#### Key Insight

There are functions that a deep network can represent **compactly** (with a reasonable number of neurons/layers), but a shallow network would need an **exponentially larger** number of neurons to achieve similar performance.

---

## Summary

- A single hidden layer **can** represent any continuous function **in theory**, but may require a vast and impractical number of neurons.
- **Deep networks** can:
  - Learn complex functions with fewer neurons,
  - Build abstract concepts in layers,
  - Are more efficient, trainable, and practical for real-world problems.
- **That’s why almost all successful neural networks today are deep networks.**

---

**TL;DR:**  
Deep networks aren't just a fad—they’re *essential* because they can learn more with less, build up understanding in stages, and make practical deep learning possible!

**USER:**

is there one activation function that most deep learning models use, such as ReLU, or do they use different ones for different layers?

**ASSISTANT:**

Great question! The **activation function** is a crucial part of neural networks—and choosing the right one can make a big difference.

---

## ELI5

Most deep learning models use the **same activation function** (usually **ReLU**) for most of their hidden layers. Think of ReLU as a simple switch that only lets "positive energy" through—which makes it fast and easy for your model to learn.

But for the **output layer**, we often use **different activation functions** depending on the problem (for example, using sigmoid for probabilities).

---

## In Practice

### Hidden Layers

- **ReLU (`Rectified Linear Unit`)** is overwhelmingly the default choice for hidden layers in most deep neural networks:
  $$
  \text{ReLU}(x) = \max(0, x)
  $$
- Variants like **Leaky ReLU**, **ELU**, or **GELU** are sometimes used, but plain **ReLU is king** for most models—especially convolutional and fully-connected networks.

### Output Layers

Here, the activation function is chosen based on the **task**:

- **Binary classification:**  
  Use **sigmoid** activation in the output layer to produce probabilities between 0 and 1.
- **Multi-class classification:**  
  Use **softmax** activation in the output layer to return probabilities across multiple classes that sum to 1.
- **Regression:**  
  Often **no activation** (just a linear output) so the network can predict any real number.
- **Special architectures:**  
  There are exceptions! (For example, tanh for RNNs, GELU for large transformer models, etc.)

### Do Different Layers Use Different Activations?

- In **most modern architectures**, hidden layers all use the *same* activation function throughout (almost always ReLU or a variant).
- It’s rare to see mixed activation functions in different hidden layers—except for some experimental or research models, or where specific needs arise.

---

## Summary

- **ReLU** is the standard activation for most hidden layers in deep networks today.
- The **output layer’s activation depends on the problem:** sigmoid, softmax, or none (linear).
- Mixing very different activations in hidden layers is *unusual*—consistency helps training!

---

**TL;DR:**  
Today’s deep nets usually “stack” many layers with **ReLU**, and select the output activation to fit the task. 🎯

**USER:**

ok, back to the article. in this equation:

$$
\mathbf{h} = f(\mathbf{X}\mathbf{W}_1 + \mathbf{b}_1)
$$

both X and W are capitalized. does that mean they are both matrices? what are they?

**ASSISTANT:**

Fantastic observation! Yes—the capitalization in math is usually intentional. In this equation:

$$
\mathbf{h} = f(\mathbf{X}\mathbf{W}_1 + \mathbf{b}_1)
$$

let’s break down each term:

---

### What are $\mathbf{X}$ and $\mathbf{W}_1$?

- **$\mathbf{X}$ (capital X):**  
  - Usually represents the **input data matrix**.  
  - Each **row** is one data example (like one image, one sample), and each **column** is a feature.  
  - If you have $N$ data points and $D$ features, $\mathbf{X}$ is an $N \times D$ matrix.

- **$\mathbf{W}_1$ (capital W):**
  - Represents the **weight matrix** for the first layer.
  - Each column of $\mathbf{W}_1$ connects all input features to one neuron in the hidden layer.
  - If your hidden layer has $H$ neurons, $\mathbf{W}_1$ is a $D \times H$ matrix (inputs $\rightarrow$ hidden).

- **$\mathbf{b}_1$ (lowercase b):**
  - The **bias vector** for the first layer.
  - It’s a $1 \times H$ vector, added to each row of the result.

- **$f(\cdot)$:**
  - The **activation function** (e.g., ReLU, sigmoid), applied to each element.

- **$\mathbf{h}$ (lowercase h):**
  - The **hidden layer activations** for each input, an $N \times H$ matrix.

---

### The Shape Story (With Example)

If you have:
- $N = 100$ samples,
- $D = 5$ features,
- $H = 10$ hidden units.

Then:
- $\mathbf{X}$ is $100 \times 5$
- $\mathbf{W}_1$ is $5 \times 10$
- So $\mathbf{X}\mathbf{W}_1$ is $100 \times 10$
- Add $\mathbf{b}_1$ (broadcast $1 \times 10$), and apply $f$: you get $\mathbf{h}$, $100 \times 10$

---

### Summary Table

| Symbol        | Shape                    | What it means              |
| ------------- | ------------------------ | -------------------------- |
| $\mathbf{X}$    | $N \times D$               | Input data (examples x features) |
| $\mathbf{W}_1$  | $D \times H$               | Weights in first layer     |
| $\mathbf{b}_1$  | $1 \times H$ or $H$        | Bias for first layer       |
| $\mathbf{h}$    | $N \times H$               | Hidden activations         |

---

**Bottom line:**  
- **Capital letters** usually mean matrices.
- **$\mathbf{X}$** is the matrix of all inputs; **$\mathbf{W}_1$** is the weight matrix for the first layer.
- The formula computes all the layer’s activations for all your input examples at once!

**USER:**

ok, another question. to be clear, each layer in a multi-layer neural network has *separate* weights and biases, correct? does this mean we need to solve for optimal weights and biases for every layer separately during training?

**ASSISTANT:**

Great question! Yes, **each layer in a multi-layer neural network has its own separate weights and biases.**

But the important thing is **how** those get "solved" or updated during training—let’s break it down:

---

## ELI5

Think of a neural network as a team of workers passing along a message. Each worker (layer) has their own set of secret instructions (weights and biases). Together, they're learning how to transform the input in the best way possible to get the right answer at the end. During training, the whole team works together to adjust **all** their instructions so the final answer improves—not just one worker at a time!

---

## Technical Explanation

### Yes, Every Layer Has Its Own Parameters

- For **every layer**, there is a different weight matrix $\mathbf{W}_l$ and bias vector $\mathbf{b}_l$.
- In a network with, say, 3 layers (excluding the input), you have:
  - $\mathbf{W}_1$, $\mathbf{b}_1$ for layer 1 (input → hidden)
  - $\mathbf{W}_2$, $\mathbf{b}_2$ for layer 2 (hidden → hidden or hidden → output)
  - ...and so on for additional layers.

### Are We Solving for Them **Separately**?

- **We do NOT optimize each layer's weights and biases separately or in isolation.**
- Instead, **the entire network is trained as a whole**:
  - You compute the loss (the error between the prediction and the true answer) at the end of the network.
  - Then, using **backpropagation**, you compute how changing *each* parameter in *each layer* influences the loss.
  - All weights and biases—across all layers—are updated together in one step (typically via gradient descent or its variants).
- **Each parameter is adjusted by following the gradient** of the overall loss with respect to *that* parameter.

### Why All Together?

Because the outputs of earlier layers become the inputs to later layers. Changing an early layer's weights affects the whole chain! The gradients are computed through the entire network ("chain rule" of calculus) so that each weight/bias gets the best update for the final prediction.

---

## Summary

- **Each layer has its own weights and biases (yes!).**
- **All layers’ parameters are updated together during training** as part of a single, whole-network optimization process—not layer by layer in isolation.
- The backpropagation algorithm ensures every weight and bias "knows" how it contributed to the final loss and gets nudged accordingly.

---

**TL;DR:**  
Each layer has its own parameters, but all are learned *together* in the training loop using backpropagation and gradient descent!

**USER:**

ok, but then what is the purpose of the difference between batch, mini-batch, and stochastic gradient descent? i thought these all updates different weights and biases, but now it seems like they all update the same weights and biases, just at different times. so what is the difference between these three methods?

**ASSISTANT:**

Excellent question! This trips up a lot of newcomers. The **difference between batch, mini-batch, and stochastic gradient descent (SGD)** is **not** about which weights or which layers get updated—they **all** update all the learnable parameters (weights and biases) of the entire network each step! The **difference** is about ***how much data is used to compute each update***, and thus **how often/how "noisily" updates are made.**

---

## ELI5

Imagine you’re learning to shoot basketball hoops:

- **Stochastic:** After *every single shot*, you immediately adjust your aim based on whether you made or missed it.
- **Mini-batch:** After a *few shots* (say, 8 or 16), you average how you did, and then adjust your aim.
- **Batch:** You take *all your shots* (maybe 100 in total), see how you did overall, and then adjust your aim *once*.

You’re always adjusting your *whole technique* (not just parts!), but you use different amounts of feedback each time.

---

## Technical Explanation

- **Each method updates **all** the parameters (weights and biases), but they differ in how the gradients (the direction of improvement) are computed:**

### 1. **Batch Gradient Descent**
- Use **all** available training data to compute the loss and gradients.
- Update parameters once per **epoch** (pass through the whole dataset).
- **Pro:** The “true” average gradient; can be more stable.
- **Con:** Very slow for large datasets (wait until you've seen all data before updating).

### 2. **Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD)**
- Use **only one** data point (sample) to compute the loss and gradients and update parameters after every sample.
- **Pro:** Very frequent updates, can help "escape" bad spots.
- **Con:** Very noisy; lots of bouncing around, not always stable.

### 3. **Mini-Batch Gradient Descent**
- Use a **small random subset** (“mini-batch,” e.g., 16, 32, 128 samples) to compute the loss and gradients, updating after each batch.
- **Pro:** Best of both worlds! Frequent enough updates, enough data per update for stable/good directions, compatible with modern hardware.

**In modern deep learning, "mini-batch" is the standard practice.**

## Summary Table

| Method             | Data per update | Updates per epoch | Speed | Noise      |
|--------------------|-----------------|-------------------|-------|------------|
| Batch              | All             | 1                 | Slow  | Very low   |
| Stochastic (SGD)   | 1               | $N$               | Fast  | Very high  |
| Mini-batch         | Few samples     | $N$/batch size    | Just right | Medium |

---

## Key Point

- *All* methods update *all* model parameters each time.
- The **difference is: how much data do you look at between updates?**
- Mini-batch is fastest and most effective for deep learning today.

---

**TL;DR:**  
Batch, mini-batch, and stochastic GD differ *only* in how much data is used to compute each parameter update, not in which parameters are updated. All update the entire network!

**USER:**

what does "MLP" mean in the exercises?

**ASSISTANT:**

Great question! **MLP** stands for **Multi-Layer Perceptron**.

---

## ELI5

Think of an MLP as a “classic” or “plain” neural network: It’s just a bunch of layers—one after another—where each layer is fully connected to the next ("dense" layers), and each uses an activation function like ReLU or sigmoid. When you see “MLP,” read it as a basic, stack-of-layers neural network.

---

## Slightly More Technical

- **Multi-Layer:** More than one layer of computation (at least one “hidden” layer between input and output).
- **Perceptron:** The original term for a very simple neuron (adds inputs, does a nonlinear squish).
- **MLP:** A neural network made up of an input layer, one or more hidden layers (each fully connected), and an output layer.

**In code** (like the exercises in your article), when you see a class `MLP`, it’s just shorthand for a “standard feedforward neural network with one or more hidden layers.”

---

## Example Architecture

```
Input → Dense Layer (weights & biases) → ReLU → Dense Layer → Output
```

---

**Bottom line:**  
When you see “MLP” in an exercise, it means “the neural network model/class defined above (with input, hidden, and output layers, as shown).” It’s the “vanilla” or “standard” neural net!

**USER:**

and what does fc1 and fc2 mean? are these properties that a class that extends nn.Module must have? does it call these functions automatically?

**ASSISTANT:**

Great questions! Let’s break them down:

---

## What Do `fc1` and `fc2` Mean?

- `fc` stands for **“fully connected”** (also called **“dense layer”**).
- In PyTorch code, it's typical to name each layer as `fc1`, `fc2`, etc.:
  - `fc1` is the **first fully connected layer** (input to hidden).
  - `fc2` is the **second fully connected layer** (hidden to output, or hidden to hidden if deeper).

So,  
```python
self.fc1 = nn.Linear(input_dim, hidden_dim)
self.fc2 = nn.Linear(hidden_dim, output_dim)
```
means you have two "fully connected" layers, one after the other.

---

## Are These Properties Required in `nn.Module`?

- **No, you don’t have to name them `fc1` and `fc2`.**  
  Those are just common, descriptive variable names by convention.
- What *is* required:
  - All layers and components you want to have parameters (like weights/biases) must be **declared as attributes** of the class.
  - You can name them whatever you wish, e.g., `layer1`, `dense`, `my_hidden`, etc.

---

## Does PyTorch Call These Functions Automatically?

- **No**, PyTorch does *not* call your layer attributes (`fc1`, etc.) directly.
- What happens is:
  - You define a special method called `forward(self, x)`.  
    In this method, you actually *call* these layers/components in the order you want, e.g.:
    ```python
    def forward(self, x):
        h = self.fc1(x)
        out = self.fc2(h)
        return out
    ```
  - *Only* the `forward` method is automatically called by PyTorch when you do `output = model(input)`.

---

## Summary Table

| Name         | Meaning                         | Required?          | Called Automatically?                        |
|--------------|---------------------------------|--------------------|----------------------------------------------|
| `fc1`, `fc2` | "Fully connected" layers        | No, just a habit   | No, you call them inside your `forward()`    |
| Layer Names  | Any (e.g. `layer1`, `dense`)    | No, any valid name | No, call them in `forward()`                |
| `forward()`  | Neural net computation method   | **Yes** (required) | **Yes, by PyTorch when you use `model(x)`**  |

---

### **Bottom line:**  

- `fc1`/`fc2` are just **conventional names** for your fully connected layers.  
- You can choose different names if you prefer.
- PyTorch only calls your `forward()` method automatically;  
  you decide what happens inside it and in what order.

**USER:**

in that case, i don't understand how the hidden dimensions worked. i thought after each layer, it is multiplied by a a nonlinear function. however, in this case, the first "hidden layer" seems to have a "hidden dimension". what does this mean? is that not the number of layers? is that the dimension of the matrix?

**ASSISTANT:**

Awesome questions—let’s clarify these ideas:

---

## 1. **What is "hidden dimension"?**

- **“Hidden dimension”** or **“hidden size”** is **not** the number of layers.  
- It is the **number of neurons (“units”) in a hidden layer**.
- Each **hidden layer** can have its own "hidden dimension" (number of neurons/output features).

So, if you see:
```python
self.fc1 = nn.Linear(input_dim, hidden_dim)
```
- `input_dim`: Number of input features (e.g., pixels for images, or whatever your input vector size is)
- `hidden_dim`: Number of neurons in the **first hidden layer** (how “wide” that layer is)

---

## 2. **What happens at each layer?**

- Each **fully connected (linear) layer** does:
  ```
  output = input @ weights + bias
  ```
  where `input` is a matrix of size `[batch_size, input_dim]` and `weights` is `[input_dim, output_dim]`.

- **Activation function**:
  After the linear layer, you usually apply a nonlinear “activation function” (like ReLU, Tanh, etc.):
  ```
  activated = activation_function(output)
  ```

So, in forward pass code:
```python
h = self.fc1(x)      # Linear transformation: [batch, hidden_dim]
a = self.act(h)      # Nonlinear activation - same shape
out = self.fc2(a)    # Next linear layer
```

---

## 3. **What does "hidden dimension" mean then?**

**Diagram:**
```
input_dim ----(fc1)----> hidden_dim ----(activation, e.g. ReLU)----> output_dim
         \_ [fc1 has: input_dim x hidden_dim weights] _/
```

- **`hidden_dim`** controls **how many features ("neurons") the hidden layer computes**.
- It’s the *width*, not the *depth* of your neural network.
- **Depth** = number of layers  
  **Width** = number of neurons in a layer (= "hidden dimension")

**More hidden units (wider hidden dimension)** lets the network represent more complex functions, but makes it bigger and potentially slower.

---

## 4. **Summary Table**

| Term              | What it means               | Controls         |
|-------------------|----------------------------|------------------|
| Layer             | One computation step (fc + nonlinearity) | Depth         |
| Hidden Layer      | Any layer between input/output | Depth         |
| Hidden Dimension / Hidden Size | # of neurons (units) in EACH layer | Width         |

---

## 5. **In short:**

- **Hidden dimension** = how many “neurons” (features) in a single hidden layer (**width**)
- **Number of layers** = how many stacked layers in the network (**depth**)
- You pass data through a layer: linear → activation → linear → activation...
- At each layer, the linear function’s **output size** (hidden dimension) controls the shape of the next layer’s input.

---

**Analogy:**  
Think of “hidden layers” as assembly lines.  
- **Depth** = how many assembly lines (steps)
- **Width (hidden dimension)** = how many workers at each step, working in parallel

---

**Bottom line:**  
- “Hidden dimension” is NOT the number of layers!  
- It’s how wide each hidden layer is: the number of neurons/features produced for the next step.
