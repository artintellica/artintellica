Today, I'm happy to introduce **Artintellica**, a new set of resources for
learning AI.

Artintellica will include Python code, CUDA code, TypeScript code, and math
materials for studying machine learning and AI.

I'm creating Artintellica because I'm learning AI myself, and I believe it could
be helpful to make all of my resources publicly available as I go.

Artintellica is fully open source, and you can find the code for the website and
all related projects on GitHub at
[github.com/artintellica/artintellica](https://github.com/artintellica/artintellica).

**Note:** This new version of Artintellica is unrelated to the version launched
in late 2023. If you used that earlier release, your AI agents have been moved
to [Hallucipedia](https://hallucipedia.com).
