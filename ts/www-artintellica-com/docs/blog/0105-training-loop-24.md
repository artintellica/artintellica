# Learn the Training Loop with PyTorch  
## Module 2.4: The Role of Activations

---

### Introduction

Welcome back to "Learn the Training Loop with PyTorch"!  
In the last blog post, you built a neural network from scratch and learned how it could learn more complex relationships than linear regression. But you might be wondering: *what really makes a neural network “non-linear,” and why is that so important*?  

Today, we’re zooming in on **activation functions**—the key ingredient that makes neural networks more expressive and capable than linear models. We'll intuitively explain what activations are, why they're needed, look at some of the most common ones, see their math, and finally visualize their impact with code.

---

## ELI5: What Is an Activation Function?  

Think of a neural network like an assembly line. At each step (layer), worker robots (neurons) add their ingredient (multiply input by weights and add bias), then pass it to the next worker. If each worker only ever demanded the *exact* recipe (just multiplying and adding), the final product would *always* be like the ingredients mixed in the same boring way, no matter how many steps you have.

An **activation function** is like a taste-tester in between workers. Each time, the taste-tester decides whether and how much of the new ingredient should go on, sometimes amplifying, squashing, or cutting things off entirely!  

Without an activation function, no matter how many layers you add, the network can only make *linear* changes to the input—like a single-layer recipe, just longer and more expensive. Activation functions let your network "think outside the line"—mixing, squashing, and transforming signals so it can learn curves, corners, and real-life complexities.

---

## Mathematical Foundations

Let’s formalize where activation functions fit into the neural network workflow.

A *single neuron* computes:

$$
a = f(z)
$$

where

- $z = \mathbf{w}^\top \mathbf{x} + b$  
   - $\mathbf{x}$: input vector  
   - $\mathbf{w}$: weight vector  
   - $b$: bias  
- $f(\cdot)$: **activation function** (e.g., ReLU, sigmoid, tanh)

A *layer* of neurons vectorizes this:

$$
\mathbf{a} = f(\mathbf{W} \mathbf{x} + \mathbf{b})
$$

where

- $\mathbf{W}$: weight matrix  
- $\mathbf{b}$: bias vector  
- $f$ is applied *element-wise* to the linear transformation's output.

Some **common activation functions**:

- **Sigmoid:**  
  $$
  \sigma(z) = \frac{1}{1 + e^{-z}}
  $$
- **Tanh:**  
  $$
  \tanh(z) = \frac{e^{z} - e^{-z}}{e^{z} + e^{-z}}
  $$
- **ReLU (Rectified Linear Unit):**  
  $$
  \mathrm{ReLU}(z) = \max(0, z)
  $$

**Why does it matter?**  
If you "stack" linear layers *without* a non-linearity between them, the result is still a linear function of the input—no more powerful than a single layer! Activations unlock *non-linear* transformations, giving networks the capacity to model almost any function.

---

## Deep Dive: Why Activation Functions Matter

Let’s break it down:

1. **Linear Layers Without Activation = Linear Model**  
    Suppose you have two linear layers:
    $$
    \mathbf{y} = \mathbf{W}_2 (\mathbf{W}_1 \mathbf{x} + \mathbf{b}_1) + \mathbf{b}_2
    $$
    You can rewrite this as:
    $$
    \mathbf{y} = \mathbf{A}\mathbf{x} + \mathbf{c}
    $$
    where $\mathbf{A} = \mathbf{W}_2\mathbf{W}_1$, $\mathbf{c} = \mathbf{W}_2\mathbf{b}_1 + \mathbf{b}_2$  
    -- still just a single linear transformation! So, *no matter how many you stack, without activations they're just one big linear operation.*

2. **Introducing Non-Linearity**
    When you wrap a non-linear activation $f(\cdot)$ between the layers:
    $$
    \mathbf{y} = \mathbf{W}_2 \cdot f(\mathbf{W}_1 \mathbf{x} + \mathbf{b}_1) + \mathbf{b}_2
    $$
    Now, the *relationship* between $\mathbf{x}$ and $\mathbf{y}$ can curve, bend, or even oscillate—depending on $f$. This makes neural networks *universal function approximators*.

3. **Practical Impacts**
    - Networks with activations can solve complex tasks (like language translation, image recognition, etc.).
    - Each activation function has unique properties. For example:
        - **Sigmoid:** outputs between $0$ and $1$, useful for probabilities, but can “saturate” and slow down learning.
        - **Tanh:** similar to sigmoid but outputs between $-1$ and $1$ (centered around $0$).
        - **ReLU:** super simple, fast to compute, and the default in modern networks—but "dies" (outputs 0) for negative values.

4. **Choosing the Right Activation**
    - Standard hidden layers: **ReLU** (or its variants)
    - Outputs for probabilities: **Sigmoid** (binary) or **Softmax** (multiclass)
    - Outputs for regression: use *no* activation (linear output) or sometimes **Tanh** for bounded outputs

## Demonstrations in PyTorch

Let’s visualize activation functions and see their *impact* on network expressiveness!

> **Install requirements (if needed):**
> ```
> uv pip install torch matplotlib

### 1. Visualizing Common Activation Functions

```python
import torch
import torch.nn.functional as F
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

def plot_activations() -> None:
    z = torch.linspace(-5, 5, steps=200)

    activations = {
        "ReLU": F.relu(z),
        "Sigmoid": torch.sigmoid(z),
        "Tanh": torch.tanh(z),
    }

    plt.figure(figsize=(8, 5))
    for name, activation in activations.items():
        plt.plot(z.numpy(), activation.numpy(), label=name)
    plt.title("Common Activation Functions")
    plt.xlabel("Input z")
    plt.ylabel("Activation(z)")
    plt.legend()
    plt.grid(True)
    plt.show()

plot_activations()
```

### 2. Why We Need Non-linear Activations: Model Expressiveness

Let’s fit a toy dataset with and without non-linearity.

```python
import torch
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import torch.nn.functional as F

def make_toy_data(n: int = 100) -> tuple[torch.Tensor, torch.Tensor]:
    # Data: input x, labels y = sin(x)
    x = torch.linspace(-2 * torch.pi, 2 * torch.pi, n).unsqueeze(1)
    y = torch.sin(x)
    return x, y

class SimpleNet(torch.nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, use_activation: bool):
        super().__init__()
        self.fc1 = torch.nn.Linear(1, 10)
        self.use_activation = use_activation
        self.fc2 = torch.nn.Linear(10, 1)
        
    def forward(self, x: torch.Tensor) -> torch.Tensor:
        x = self.fc1(x)
        if self.use_activation:
            x = F.relu(x)  # Try also with torch.tanh(x)
        x = self.fc2(x)
        return x

def train_model(use_activation: bool, epochs: int = 1000) -> torch.nn.Module:
    x, y = make_toy_data()
    model = SimpleNet(use_activation)
    optimizer = torch.optim.Adam(model.parameters(), lr=0.01)
    for _ in range(epochs):
        y_pred = model(x)
        loss = F.mse_loss(y_pred, y)
        optimizer.zero_grad()
        loss.backward()
        optimizer.step()
    return model

def plot_fit_with_and_without_activation():
    x, y = make_toy_data()
    models = {
        "No Activation (Linear Only)": train_model(use_activation=False, epochs=1000),
        "With ReLU Activation": train_model(use_activation=True, epochs=1000),
    }

    plt.figure(figsize=(8, 5))
    plt.plot(x.numpy(), y.numpy(), label="True sin(x)", color="black", linewidth=2)
    for label, model in models.items():
        y_pred = model(x).detach()
        plt.plot(x.numpy(), y_pred.numpy(), label=label)

    plt.title("Linear v.s. Non-linear (ReLU) Neural Network Fit")
    plt.xlabel("x")
    plt.ylabel("y")
    plt.legend()
    plt.grid(True)
    plt.show()

plot_fit_with_and_without_activation()
```

Try replacing `F.relu(x)` with `torch.tanh(x)` in the model above, and see how much better the fit gets for a sinusoidal function!

## Exercises

### 1. **Exercise: Plot the Derivative of Each Activation**

Modify the given activation plotting code to plot not just each function, but its derivative as well.  
*Why?* The gradient affects learning speed and stability!

```python
def plot_activation_and_derivative() -> None:
    z = torch.linspace(-5, 5, steps=200)
    activations = {
        "ReLU": (F.relu(z), (z > 0).float()),
        "Sigmoid": (torch.sigmoid(z), torch.sigmoid(z) * (1 - torch.sigmoid(z))),
        "Tanh": (torch.tanh(z), 1 - torch.tanh(z) ** 2),
    }
    plt.figure(figsize=(10, 6))
    for idx, (name, (val, grad)) in enumerate(activations.items()):
        plt.subplot(2, 3, idx+1)
        plt.plot(z.numpy(), val.numpy())
        plt.title(f"{name}")
        plt.subplot(2, 3, idx+4)
        plt.plot(z.numpy(), grad.numpy())
        plt.title(f"{name} Derivative")
    plt.tight_layout()
    plt.show()

plot_activation_and_derivative()
```

---

### 2. **Exercise: Swap in Tanh for ReLU**

In the toy function-fitting code above, swap the `F.relu(x)` to `torch.tanh(x)` and retrain. Which activation works better for approximating $\sin(x)$?  
*Answer: Tanh matches the shape much better, because its output range $(-1, 1)$ matches $\sin(x)$'s output!*

---

### 3. **Exercise: Build a Custom Activation Function**

Create a custom PyTorch activation function called "Swish," defined as $f(z) = z \cdot \sigma(z)$.

```python
def swish(z: torch.Tensor) -> torch.Tensor:
    return z * torch.sigmoid(z)

# Visualize Swish
z = torch.linspace(-5, 5, steps=200)
plt.plot(z.numpy(), swish(z).numpy(), label="Swish")
plt.legend()
plt.grid(True)
plt.title("Swish Activation Function")
plt.show()
```

---

## Summary

- **Activation functions** are what make neural networks *nonlinear*—and therefore powerful enough to learn complex, realistic data.
- Stack of *linear* layers (no activation) = *still a linear model!*
- Common activations: **ReLU**, **Sigmoid**, **Tanh**—each with pros and cons. ReLU is simple and most common, while Tanh/Sigmoid are saturating (slow to learn at extremes) but sometimes useful.
- Choice of activation impacts how well your network learns, especially depending on your data and output range.

---

## Key Takeaways

- Activation functions introduce *non-linearity*—the “magic ingredient” in deep learning.
- You must use activations between layers to unlock the power of neural networks.
- Each activation function has unique properties affecting learning and expressiveness.
- Visualization is a great way to understand how activations work!
- *Always* consider your output’s range and the problem type (classification, regression) when choosing activations.

---

**Next up:** Mini-batching and data pipelines—how and why we feed data in small chunks to networks for efficient, robust learning!

**USER:**

in your mathematical examples, you seem to use W as a matrix and x as a vector. however, in other examples, i have done it the other way around: with X as a matrix and w as a vector. how do we know when approach is useful? does this make a big difference, such as whether there are more weights than data points, or vice versa?

**ASSISTANT:**

Great question! This is a common source of confusion when reading machine learning and deep learning materials, since different authors use different **indexing conventions**. Here’s how to make sense of it:

---

## 1. **Single Data Point vs. Batch of Data Points**

### **Single Data Point ("Column Vector" Convention)**

When we process **one example** at a time, we often write:

- $\mathbf{x}$: an input **vector** (e.g., shape $[d]$, where $d$ is the number of features)
- $\mathbf{w}$: a weight **vector** (same shape as $\mathbf{x}$)
- $b$: scalar bias
- Output: $y = \mathbf{w}^\top \mathbf{x} + b$

This matches the typical “linear algebra” convention and is easy for writing math involving one input.

---

### **Batch Processing ("Matrix" Convention)**

When we process **multiple data points at once** (a *batch*), we usually stack the data into a **matrix**:

- $\mathbf{X}$: input **matrix**, shape $[n, d]$ ($n$ examples, $d$ features)
- $\mathbf{w}$: weight **vector**, shape $[d]$
- $\mathbf{b}$: optionally a bias **vector** (or $b$ scalar)
- Output: $\mathbf{y} = \mathbf{X}\mathbf{w} + \mathbf{b}$ ($\mathbf{y}$ is shape $[n]$)

So in this notation:
  - $\mathbf{X}$ rows = data points
  - $\mathbf{w}$ = weights to be learned
  - Each output: $y_i = \mathbf{w}^\top \mathbf{x}_i + b$ for each example $i$.

This **batch notation** is standard in PyTorch, TensorFlow, and other frameworks, because it enables efficient computation for lots of data at once.

---

## 2. **Are the Conventions Interchangeable?**

Yes, *with care.* The meanings are compatible—they’re just different levels of abstraction:

- **Single input math** = vectors
- **Multiple inputs ("batched" math)** = matrices

You can always write the “batched” case with matrices/vectors, and the “single” case by picking out one row.

---

## 3. **Does It Matter: More Data Points or More Weights?**

The **shape** of $\mathbf{X}$ and $\mathbf{w}$ will depend on your data:

- **$\mathbf{X}$: [number of samples, number of features]**
- **$\mathbf{w}$: [number of features]**

It *doesn’t matter* if you have more data points than weights, or vice versa, in terms of which convention you use. What matters:

- The math must line up (you can only add/multiply compatible shapes).
- In underdetermined/overdetermined systems (few data points but many features, or vice versa), this affects regularization and optimization, but *not* the mathematical notation.

---

## 4. **How Does This Translate to Neural Networks?**

For a dense (fully connected) neural network layer in PyTorch, the input is always a matrix of shape $[n, d]$ (batch size $n$, input features $d$), and the layer's weights are a matrix of shape $[d, h]$ (where $h$ is the output size). The basic operation:

$$
\mathbf{Y} = \mathbf{X} \mathbf{W} + \mathbf{b}
$$

- $\mathbf{X}$: $[n, d]$
- $\mathbf{W}$: $[d, h]$
- $\mathbf{Y}$: $[n, h]$

This is why you often see $\mathbf{X}$ as a matrix (inputs), and $\mathbf{W}$ as a matrix (weights from each input to each output unit/neuron).

---

## 5. **Summary Table**

| Symbol         | Typical shape  | Meaning                                        | Usage                  |
| -------------- | -------------- | ----------------------------------------------- | ---------------------- |
| $\mathbf{x}$   | $[d]$          | Single input vector                            | Single input math      |
| $\mathbf{X}$   | $[n, d]$       | Matrix of $n$ inputs, each with $d$ features   | Batch processing       |
| $\mathbf{w}$   | $[d]$          | Weight vector for a simple linear model        | Linear regression      |
| $\mathbf{W}$   | $[d, h]$       | Weight matrix for multilayer/NN                | Neural networks        |
| $b$, $\mathbf{b}$ | scalar or vector | Bias term                                 | Both                   |
| $y$, $\mathbf{y}$ | scalar or $[n]$ | Predicted output(s)                        | Both                   |

---

## 6. **Key Takeaways**

- Both notations are correct—just careful to match *dimensions*.
- Batch notation is the industry standard (especially in code and deep learning).
- The choice doesn’t affect learning (more data points, more weights, etc.), just the math and code convenience.

---

If you ever get confused, **write out the shapes** for each term and check that the multiplication/addition makes sense! This habit will save you endless debugging time in both math and PyTorch.

**USER:**

ok, you've mentioned "dense" neural networks. i have encounntered this term before, but i don't know what this means. this is a bit of a tangent, but can you please briefly explain the difference between "dense" and "sparse" neural networks? and when are sparse networks useful?

**ASSISTANT:**

Absolutely! This is a great foundational question, and understanding it will help you grasp both deep learning architectures and practical efficiency tricks.

---

## **What is a "Dense" (Fully Connected) Neural Network?**

A **dense** neural network layer (also called a **fully connected** layer) is one where ***every neuron in one layer is connected to every neuron in the next***.  
- **All connections exist.**  
- **All weights are "filled in" (nonzero, in principle).**

Mathematically, for input $\mathbf{x}$ (with $d$ features) and output $\mathbf{y}$ (with $h$ features):

$$
\mathbf{y} = \mathbf{W}^\top \mathbf{x} + \mathbf{b}
$$

where $\mathbf{W}$ is a weight matrix of shape $[d, h]$, and **every entry in $\mathbf{W}$ multiplies an input to an output.**

**In PyTorch:**  
```python
import torch.nn as nn
layer = nn.Linear(in_features=d, out_features=h)
```
This is a *dense* (fully connected) linear layer.

---

## **What is a "Sparse" Neural Network?**

A **sparse** neural network is designed so that ***most of the possible connections between neurons are simply not there*** (they're missing, or, mathematically, set to zero).
- Only a **small fraction** of the possible weights/connections are nonzero.
- The weight matrix is mostly zeros (the *sparse* part), only a few actual (nonzero) weights exist.

**Why make it sparse?**
- To **save memory** (zero weights don't need to be stored),
- To **save computation** (don't need to compute for zero weights),
- To sometimes **encourage generalization** (*regularization* effect).

### **Sparse Examples:**
- **Pruned Networks:** Take a trained dense net and "remove" connections/weights that aren't important (nearly zero).
- **Small-world or random graphs:** Not every neuron connects to every neuron by design.
- **Certain architectures:**  
  - **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs):** Each neuron only looks at a small patch of the input (not fully connected).
  - **Transformers with sparse attention:** Only allow certain interactions.

---

## **When Are Sparse Networks Useful?**

1. **Efficiency:**  
   - For very large models (think LLMs or big vision models), making networks sparse (fewer connections) can drastically reduce memory and speed up computation.

2. **Overfitting Avoidance:**  
   - Fewer connections can mean less overfitting—makes the network simpler/regularized.

3. **After Pruning:**  
   - You can train a large dense network, then “prune” unimportant connections, leaving a smaller, sparse but still effective model.

4. **Special Structure:**  
   - Sometimes your domain has known structure (for example, only certain sensors can affect certain outputs), so a sparse network is **more interpretable** and fits the problem better.

---

## **Summary Table**

| Type          | Connections                               | When to use                                      |
|---------------|-------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| **Dense**     | Every neuron to every neuron              | Simple problems, default, when interpretability isn't a concern; fits most use cases in small/medium networks |
| **Sparse**    | Only a subset of possible connections     | Large-scale models, after pruning, domain-specific structure, efficiency important |

---

## **Key Takeaways**

- **Dense = fully connected = all possible neuron links.**
- **Sparse = mostly zero weights = only a few actual connections.**
- Dense is the default, but sparse is vital for massive models, speed/memory optimizations, or domain constraints.

If you’re getting started, think of “dense” as the standard. Once you deal with large models or have special constraints, “sparse” becomes important!

---

If you want to play with sparsity in PyTorch, check out [`torch.nn.utils.prune`](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/generated/torch.nn.utils.prune.html) for basic pruning tools.

**USER:**

it's a bit odd to me that we add these seemingly arbitrary nonlinear functions to the network. is there some underlying conceptual reason for this, or was it just discovered that this was the key to making it so that neural networks can approximate any function?

**ASSISTANT:**

This is a really insightful question! It does seem a bit “magical” at first—that adding non-linear “squash” functions like sigmoid, tanh, or ReLU between matrix multiplications suddenly gives neural networks their *remarkable* power.

Let’s address **why we need nonlinearity conceptually**, and how this idea arose in the theory and practice of neural networks.

---

## Conceptual Motivation: Why Nonlinearity?

### 1. **Linear Functions are Limited**

- **Linear layers** (matrix multiplications + addition) can only “stretch,” “shrink,” “rotate,” or “translate” data, but **can’t make curves, corners, or bends** in the function you learn.
- Even if you stack many linear layers, the result is *still* a linear transformation—a single matrix multiplication.

### 2. **Composing Nonlinear Functions = Rich Function Space**

- The *real world* is rarely linear! Data is messy, with curves, discontinuities, and complicated input/output relationships.
- Composing even very simple nonlinear functions with linear transformations allows for *infinite* flexibility in the kind of functions we can create.

### 3. **Universal Approximation Theorem**

- Theoretically, it has been *proven* that a neural network with at least one hidden layer and a non-linear activation function can approximate **any continuous function** to arbitrary accuracy (given enough units).
- The nonlinearity does not need to be complicated—almost any “squash” (e.g., sigmoid, tanh, ReLU) is enough.
- This mathematical result dates back to work by Cybenko (1989) for sigmoidal functions, and was later generalized.

### 4. **Why Specifically These Activation Functions?**

- Historically, **sigmoid** mirrored an idealized neuron’s “firing” behavior (“saturates” from 0 to 1).
- Later, simplicity and speed won out: **ReLU** is now preferred because it’s fast to compute, does not “saturate” as much, and works well in practice.
- The **shape** isn’t crucial—what matters most is that the activation is *nonlinear* and (ideally) differentiable, so you can train with gradient descent.

### 5. **Analogy**

Think of building with LEGO blocks:
- *Linear layers* are like stacking only flat plates—you can never make something that “bends” or “arches.”
- When you *add* a few curved or angled bricks (nonlinear activations), suddenly you can build complex, flexible shapes!

## History vs. Theory

- Originally, these activation functions were somewhat inspired by biology, but **their inclusion is mathematically required** for networks to achieve more than any regular linear method.
- The *specific shape* (sigmoid, tanh, ReLU, etc.) is often a practical matter—biologically inspired at first, but now mainly chosen for stability and speed.

## **Summary Table**

| Without Nonlinearity     | With Nonlinearity    |
|-------------------------|----------------------|
| Only linear mappings    | Capable of complex, flexible mappings |
| Cannot model curves, logical “OR”/“AND”, etc. | Can model arbitrary continuous functions, logical gates, images, etc. |
| More layers = same as one layer | More layers = more power (depth matters) |
| Easy to optimize, limited utility | Requires nonlinearity to be trainable, but is vastly more expressive |

## **Key Point**

**Nonlinearity is not arbitrary—it is *essential* for function approximation.**  
Without it, neural nets cannot distinguish themselves from simple regression!

---

So, this “add a nonlinear activation and magic happens” is not just an accident of history:  
It is the mathematically necessary way to turn a “linear stretcher” into a “universal function machine.” The specific choice (sigmoid, tanh, ReLU) is practical, but *having* nonlinearity is foundational.
