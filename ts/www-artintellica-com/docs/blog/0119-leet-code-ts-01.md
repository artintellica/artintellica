## Introduction

Congratulations! ðŸŽ‰ You've made it to the end of our "Learn the Training Loop
with PyTorch" series. Over the course of these blog posts, we've taken a deep
dive into the foundational ideas of training machine learning models,
implemented these concepts by hand, and then explored how modern deep learning
frameworks supercharge the process. In this conclusion, we'll recap the key
lessons, offer a high-level summary, and provide a full table of contents for
easy navigation.

## ELI5: What Did We Learn?

Imagine teaching a robot to throw a ball into a basket. At first, the robot
guesses how to throw. Every time it misses, you tell it by how much (the
"loss"), and it learns to adjust its technique a little bit. Over time, by
repeating this process (the "training loop"), the robot gets better and better.

This is what we do in machine learning:

- **Make a prediction** ($\rightarrow$ forward pass)
- **See how wrong we were** ($\rightarrow$ loss)
- **Figure out how to improve** ($\rightarrow$ gradients)
- **Update our knowledge** ($\rightarrow$ optimize parameters)
- **Repeat until we're good enough** ($\rightarrow$ training loop)

We started with simple math and linear models, then built up to neural networks,
explored optimization tricks, and saw how these become the backbone of today's
AI.

## Mathematical Foundations: A Quick Review

Throughout the series, we've used math both for clarity and for intuition. Here
are some of the key equations we've seen:

- **Linear regression**:
  $$
  \mathbf{y} = \mathbf{X}\mathbf{w} + \mathbf{b}
  $$
- **Loss function (MSE)**:
  $$
  L(\mathbf{w}) = \frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=1}^n (y_i - \hat{y}_i)^2
  $$
- **Gradient descent update rule**:
  $$
  \mathbf{w}_{\text{new}} = \mathbf{w}_{\text{old}} - \eta \nabla_{\mathbf{w}} L(\mathbf{w})
  $$
- **Neural network forward pass** (for a single hidden layer):
  $$
  \mathbf{h} = \sigma(\mathbf{X}\mathbf{W}_1 + \mathbf{b}_1)
  $$
  $$
  \mathbf{\hat{y}} = \mathbf{h}\mathbf{W}_2 + \mathbf{b}_2
  $$

Where:

- $\mathbf{X}$ is the input,
- $\mathbf{w}$, $\mathbf{W}_1$, $\mathbf{W}_2$ are weights,
- $\mathbf{b}$, $\mathbf{b}_1$, $\mathbf{b}_2$ are biases,
- $\sigma$ is an activation function (e.g., ReLU, sigmoid).

## Pulling It All Together

Let's tie together the core steps of the training loop, as we've learned and
coded:

### The Modern PyTorch Training Loop

```python
import torch
from torch import nn, optim

# Use GPU (cuda/mps) if available, otherwise fallback to CPU
def get_device() -> torch.device:
    if torch.cuda.is_available():
        return torch.device('cuda')
    elif torch.backends.mps.is_available():
        return torch.device('mps')
    else:
        return torch.device('cpu')

device = get_device()

# Example: a simple 2-layer neural network
class SimpleNet(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, in_features: int, hidden_size: int, out_features: int):
        super().__init__()
        self.fc1 = nn.Linear(in_features, hidden_size)
        self.relu = nn.ReLU()
        self.fc2 = nn.Linear(hidden_size, out_features)

    def forward(self, x: torch.Tensor) -> torch.Tensor:
        return self.fc2(self.relu(self.fc1(x)))

# Toy dataset
torch.manual_seed(42)
X = torch.randn(256, 3).to(device)
y = torch.randn(256, 1).to(device)

model = SimpleNet(3, 8, 1).to(device)
criterion = nn.MSELoss()
optimizer = optim.Adam(model.parameters(), lr=1e-2)

num_epochs = 200

for epoch in range(num_epochs):
    model.train()
    optimizer.zero_grad()
    outputs = model(X)
    loss = criterion(outputs, y)
    loss.backward()
    optimizer.step()

    if (epoch+1) % 40 == 0 or epoch == 0:
        print(f"Epoch {epoch+1:>3}: Loss = {loss.item():.4f}")
```

_Install dependencies (if needed) using:_

```
uv pip install torch matplotlib
```

This simple example summarizes what we've practiced:

- Define a model.
- Define a loss.
- Optimize parameters via the training loop.
- Monitor your progress.

## Exercises

Try these final exercises to review your series journey!

### 1. Implement Learning Rate Scheduling

**Task:** Modify the above example to halve the learning rate every 50 epochs.

**Solution:**

```python
from torch.optim.lr_scheduler import StepLR

optimizer = optim.Adam(model.parameters(), lr=1e-2)
scheduler = StepLR(optimizer, step_size=50, gamma=0.5)

for epoch in range(num_epochs):
    model.train()
    optimizer.zero_grad()
    outputs = model(X)
    loss = criterion(outputs, y)
    loss.backward()
    optimizer.step()
    scheduler.step()

    if (epoch+1) % 40 == 0 or epoch == 0:
        print(f"Epoch {epoch+1:>3}: Loss = {loss.item():.4f}, LR = {optimizer.param_groups[0]['lr']:.5f}")
```

---

### 2. Try a Different Activation Function

**Task:** Swap `ReLU` for `Tanh` in the `SimpleNet` class.

**Solution:**

```python
self.relu = nn.Tanh()
```

---

### 3. Add L2 Regularization

**Task:** Add weight decay (L2 regularization) with Adam.

**Solution:**

```python
optimizer = optim.Adam(model.parameters(), lr=1e-2, weight_decay=1e-4)
```

---

### 4. Plot the Loss Curve

**Task:** Use matplotlib to plot the loss after every epoch.

**Solution:**

```python
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

losses = []

for epoch in range(num_epochs):
    model.train()
    optimizer.zero_grad()
    outputs = model(X)
    loss = criterion(outputs, y)
    loss.backward()
    optimizer.step()
    scheduler.step()
    losses.append(loss.item())

plt.plot(losses)
plt.xlabel('Epoch')
plt.ylabel('Loss')
plt.title('Training Loss Curve')
plt.show()
```

## Summary & Key Takeaways

- **The training loop is the heart of machine learning:** Itâ€™s a repetitious
  process where a model learns from its mistakes and gradually improves.
- **Math builds intuition:** Understanding linear algebra, gradients, and loss
  functions demystifies machine learning.
- **Modern deep learning leverages decades of innovation:** Advanced optimizers,
  flexible architectures, data pipelines, and hardware acceleration all
  originate from the same basic ideas.
- **PyTorch makes it accessible:** PyTorch turns abstract math into
  reproducible, readable code and experiments.
- **There's always more to learn:** Topics like fine-tuning, transfer learning,
  self-supervision, and emergent behavior build on the same training loop core.
