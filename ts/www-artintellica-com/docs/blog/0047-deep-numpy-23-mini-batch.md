# Learn Deep Learning with NumPy, Part 2.3: Mini-Batch Gradient Descent

## Introduction

Welcome back to our blog series, _"Learn Deep Learning with NumPy"_! In Part
2.2, we implemented gradient descent to minimize loss by iteratively updating
model parameters for linear regression. However, when dealing with large
datasets—common in deep learning—processing the entire dataset in one go (batch
gradient descent) can be computationally expensive. In Part 2.3, we’re extending
gradient descent to _mini-batch gradient descent_, a more efficient approach
that processes smaller subsets of data at a time, making it critical for
training neural networks on large datasets.

By the end of this post, you’ll understand the concept of mini-batches, why they
improve training efficiency, and how to modify our `gradient_descent()` function
to support mini-batch processing. We’ll also apply this to a binary
classification task using a subset of the MNIST dataset (digits 0 vs. 1) with
logistic regression. This enhancement to our toolkit will ensure scalability for
larger models like MLPs and CNNs in future chapters. Let’s dive into the math
and code for mini-batch optimization!

## Why Mini-Batch Gradient Descent Matters in Deep Learning

Gradient descent, as implemented in Part 2.2, processes the entire dataset in
each iteration to compute gradients and update parameters. This approach, known
as _batch gradient descent_, provides accurate gradient estimates but can be
slow and memory-intensive for large datasets like MNIST (60,000 images) or
real-world datasets with millions of samples.

_Mini-batch gradient descent_ addresses this by splitting the dataset into
smaller subsets called mini-batches (e.g., 32 or 64 samples at a time). In each
iteration, it computes gradients and updates parameters using only one
mini-batch, cycling through all mini-batches to complete an _epoch_ (one full
pass through the dataset). This offers several advantages:

- **Efficiency**: Processing smaller batches reduces memory usage and allows for
  faster updates, especially on hardware with limited resources like CPUs.
- **Faster Convergence**: Frequent updates (multiple per epoch) can lead to
  faster convergence compared to waiting for a full dataset pass.
- **Better Generalization**: The noise introduced by using subsets of data can
  act as a form of regularization, helping the model avoid overfitting.

Mini-batch gradient descent is the standard in deep learning, striking a balance
between the accuracy of batch gradient descent and the speed of stochastic
gradient descent (which uses just one sample per update). Let’s explore the math
behind it and extend our implementation.

---

## Mathematical Foundations: Mini-Batch Gradient Descent

In batch gradient descent, the gradient of the loss with respect to a parameter
$W$ (e.g., weights) is computed over the entire dataset of $n$ samples. For Mean
Squared Error (MSE), it is:

$$
\nabla_W L = \frac{1}{n} X^T (y_{\text{pred}} - y)
$$

Where $X$ is the input matrix, $y_{\text{pred}}$ is the predicted output, and
$y$ is the true output.

In _mini-batch gradient descent_, we compute the gradient over a smaller subset
(mini-batch) of $m$ samples, where $m$ is the batch size (e.g., 32). For a
mini-batch with inputs $X_{\text{batch}}$ (shape $m \times d$), predictions
$y_{\text{pred,batch}}$, and true values $y_{\text{batch}}$, the gradient is:

$$
\nabla_W L = \frac{1}{m} X_{\text{batch}}^T (y_{\text{pred,batch}} - y_{\text{batch}})
$$

Similarly, for the bias $b$:

$$
\nabla_b L = \frac{1}{m} \sum_{i=1}^m (y_{\text{pred,batch},i} - y_{\text{batch},i})
$$

The parameters are updated using the same rule as before:

$$
W \leftarrow W - \eta \nabla_W L, \quad b \leftarrow b - \eta \nabla_b L
$$

Where $\eta$ is the learning rate. By iterating over mini-batches, we
approximate the full gradient with less computation per update, cycling through
all mini-batches to cover the entire dataset in one epoch. Now, let’s modify our
`gradient_descent()` function to support mini-batches and apply it to a
real-world task.

## Implementing Mini-Batch Gradient Descent with NumPy

We’ll update our `gradient_descent()` function to process data in mini-batches,
making it more scalable for large datasets. We’ll also introduce an optional
`activation_fn` parameter to support logistic regression (for binary
classification) in addition to linear regression. Finally, we’ll test it on a
binary subset of the MNIST dataset (digits 0 vs. 1) using logistic regression
with sigmoid activation and binary cross-entropy loss.

### Updated Gradient Descent with Mini-Batches

Here’s the enhanced implementation with support for mini-batches and flexibility
for activation functions:

```python
import numpy as np
from numpy.typing import NDArray
from typing import Union, Callable, Tuple, List

def gradient_descent(X: NDArray[np.floating], y: NDArray[np.floating], W: NDArray[np.floating],
                     b: NDArray[np.floating], lr: float, num_epochs: int, batch_size: int,
                     loss_fn: Callable[[NDArray[np.floating], NDArray[np.floating]], float],
                     activation_fn: Callable[[NDArray[np.floating]], NDArray[np.floating]] = lambda x: x) -> Tuple[NDArray[np.floating], NDArray[np.floating], List[float]]:
    """

        W: Initial weights, shape (n_features, 1)
        b: Initial bias, shape (1,) or (1,1)

    """
    n_samples = X.shape[0]
    loss_history = []

    for epoch in range(num_epochs):
        # Shuffle the dataset to ensure random mini-batches
        indices = np.random.permutation(n_samples)
        X_shuffled = X[indices]
        y_shuffled = y[indices]

        # Process mini-batches
        for start_idx in range(0, n_samples, batch_size):
            end_idx = min(start_idx + batch_size, n_samples)
            X_batch = X_shuffled[start_idx:end_idx]
            y_batch = y_shuffled[start_idx:end_idx]
            batch_size_actual = X_batch.shape[0]

            # Forward pass: Compute linear output and apply activation
            Z_batch = X_batch @ W + b
            y_pred_batch = activation_fn(Z_batch)
            # Compute gradients (works for MSE with identity or BCE with sigmoid)
            error = y_pred_batch - y_batch
            grad_W = (X_batch.T @ error) / batch_size_actual
            grad_b = np.mean(error)
            # Update parameters
            W = W - lr * grad_W
            b = b - lr * grad_b

        # Compute loss on full dataset at end of epoch
        y_pred_full = activation_fn(X @ W + b)
        loss = loss_fn(y_pred_full, y)
        loss_history.append(loss)
        print(f"Epoch {epoch+1}/{num_epochs}, Loss: {loss:.4f}")

    return W, b, loss_history
```

### Example: Logistic Regression on MNIST (0 vs. 1) with Mini-Batches

Let’s apply mini-batch gradient descent to train a logistic regression model on
a binary subset of the MNIST dataset (digits 0 vs. 1). We’ll use sigmoid
activation and binary cross-entropy loss. First, ensure you have the necessary
dependencies and data.

**Note**: If you don’t have `sklearn` installed, run `pip install scikit-learn`
to load MNIST. We’ll load a small subset for simplicity and CPU efficiency.

```python
# Load MNIST data (subset for digits 0 and 1)
from sklearn.datasets import fetch_openml
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split

# Load MNIST dataset (this may take a moment)
X_full, y_full = fetch_openml('mnist_784', version=1, return_X_y=True, as_frame=False)
y_full = y_full.astype(int)
X_full = X_full.astype(float)

# Filter for digits 0 and 1 (binary classification)
mask = (y_full == 0) | (y_full == 1)
X = X_full[mask][:1000]  # Limit to 1000 samples for faster training on CPU
y = y_full[mask][:1000]
y = y.reshape(-1, 1)  # Shape (n_samples, 1)
X = normalize(X)  # Normalize pixel values using our function

# Split into train and test sets
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)

# Initialize parameters
n_features = X_train.shape[1]
W_init = np.zeros((n_features, 1))  # Initial weights
b_init = np.zeros((1, 1))  # Initial bias
lr = 0.1  # Learning rate
num_epochs = 10  # Number of epochs
batch_size = 32  # Mini-batch size

# Train logistic regression with sigmoid activation and BCE loss
W_final, b_final, losses = gradient_descent(
    X_train, y_train, W_init, b_init, lr, num_epochs, batch_size,
    loss_fn=binary_cross_entropy, activation_fn=sigmoid
)

# Evaluate on test set
y_pred_test = sigmoid(X_test @ W_final + b_final)
test_loss = binary_cross_entropy(y_pred_test, y_test)
accuracy = np.mean((y_pred_test > 0.5) == y_test)
print("Test Loss:", test_loss)
print("Test Accuracy:", accuracy)
```

**Output** (values are approximate and may vary due to randomness):

```
Epoch 1/10, Loss: 0.4123
Epoch 2/10, Loss: 0.3567
...
Epoch 10/10, Loss: 0.1892
Test Loss: 0.1925
Test Accuracy: 0.935
```

In this example, we train a logistic regression model on a binary subset of
MNIST (digits 0 vs. 1) using mini-batch gradient descent. The model processes 32
samples at a time, shuffling the data each epoch to ensure randomness. Over 10
epochs, the loss decreases, and we achieve a reasonable accuracy on the test set
(e.g., ~93%), demonstrating the effectiveness of mini-batch training for
scalability. Training times are manageable on a CPU due to the small subset and
mini-batch approach (~a few seconds per epoch).

## Organizing Our Growing Library

Let’s update our `neural_network.py` file to reflect the enhanced

`from neural_network import gradient_descent`. The addition of mini-batch
support and flexibility with activation functions makes it scalable and
adaptable for training various models, from linear regression to logistic
regression, and eventually neural networks.

## Exercises: Practice with Mini-Batch Gradient Descent

To reinforce your understanding of mini-batch gradient descent, try these
Python-focused coding exercises. They’ll prepare you for training larger models
on real datasets in future chapters. Run the code and compare outputs to verify
your solutions.

1. **Mini-Batch Gradient Descent on Synthetic Linear Regression Data**  
   Create synthetic data with
   `X = np.array([[1.0], [2.0], [3.0], [4.0], [5.0], [6.0], [7.0], [8.0]])` and
   `y = np.array([[2.0], [4.0], [6.0], [8.0], [10.0], [12.0], [14.0], [16.0]])`
   (true relationship $y = 2x$). Initialize `W = np.array([[0.0]])` and
   `b = np.array([[0.0]])`. Run `gradient_descent()` with `lr = 0.01`,
   `num_epochs = 5`, and `batch_size = 2`. Print the initial and final values of
   `W`, `b`, and the loss history.

   ```python
   # Your code here
   X = np.array([[1.0], [2.0], [3.0], [4.0], [5.0], [6.0], [7.0], [8.0]])
   y = np.array([[2.0], [4.0], [6.0], [8.0], [10.0], [12.0], [14.0], [16.0]])
   W_init = np.array([[0.0]])
   b_init = np.array([[0.0]])
   lr = 0.01
   num_epochs = 5
   batch_size = 2
   W_final, b_final, losses = gradient_descent(X, y, W_init, b_init, lr, num_epochs, batch_size, mse_loss)
   print("Initial weight W:", W_init)
   print("Initial bias b:", b_init)
   print("Final weight W:", W_final)
   print("Final bias b:", b_final)
   print("Loss history:", losses)
   ```

2. **Effect of Batch Size on Convergence**  
   Using the same data as in Exercise 1, run `gradient_descent()` with
   `lr = 0.01`, `num_epochs = 5`, but with a larger `batch_size = 4`. Compare the
   final `W`, `b`, and loss history to Exercise 1. Observe how a larger batch
   size might affect convergence speed or stability.

   ```python
   # Your code here
   X = np.array([[1.0], [2.0], [3.0], [4.0], [5.0], [6.0], [7.0], [8.0]])
   y = np.array([[2.0], [4.0], [6.0], [8.0], [10.0], [12.0], [14.0], [16.0]])
   W_init = np.array([[0.0]])
   b_init = np.array([[0.0]])
   lr = 0.01
   num_epochs = 5
   batch_size = 4
   W_final, b_final, losses = gradient_descent(X, y, W_init, b_init, lr, num_epochs, batch_size, mse_loss)
   print("Initial weight W:", W_init)
   print("Initial bias b:", b_init)
   print("Final weight W:", W_final)
   print("Final bias b:", b_final)
   print("Loss history:", losses)
   ```

3. **Mini-Batch Logistic Regression on Synthetic Data**  
   Create synthetic binary classification data with
   `X = np.array([[0.5], [1.5], [1.0], [2.0], [3.0], [2.5]])` and
   `y = np.array([[0.0], [0.0], [0.0], [1.0], [1.0], [1.0]])` (approximating a
   decision boundary). Initialize `W = np.array([[0.0]])` and
   `b = np.array([[0.0]])`. Run `gradient_descent()` with `lr = 0.01`,
   `num_epochs = 10`, `batch_size = 2`, using `binary_cross_entropy` as
   `loss_fn` and `sigmoid` as `activation_fn`. Print the initial and final `W`,
   `b`, and loss history.

   ```python
   # Your code here
   X = np.array([[0.5], [1.5], [1.0], [2.0], [3.0], [2.5]])
   y = np.array([[0.0], [0.0], [0.0], [1.0], [1.0], [1.0]])
   W_init = np.array([[0.0]])
   b_init = np.array([[0.0]])
   lr = 0.01
   num_epochs = 10
   batch_size = 2
   W_final, b_final, losses = gradient_descent(X, y, W_init, b_init, lr, num_epochs, batch_size, binary_cross_entropy, sigmoid)
   print("Initial weight W:", W_init)
   print("Initial bias b:", b_init)
   print("Final weight W:", W_final)
   print("Final bias b:", b_final)
   print("Loss history:", losses)
   ```

4. **Effect of Shuffling in Mini-Batches**  
   Modify the `gradient_descent()` function temporarily to remove shuffling
   (comment out the `np.random.permutation` part and use `X` and `y` directly).
   Run it on the data from Exercise 1 with `lr = 0.01`, `num_epochs = 5`, and
   `batch_size = 2`. Compare the loss history to Exercise 1. Observe how the
   lack of shuffling might affect convergence due to consistent batch ordering.

   ```python
   # Your code here (modify gradient_descent temporarily)
   def gradient_descent_no_shuffle(X, y, W, b, lr, num_epochs, batch_size, loss_fn, activation_fn=lambda x: x):
       n_samples = X.shape[0]
       loss_history = []
       for epoch in range(num_epochs):
           for start_idx in range(0, n_samples, batch_size):
               end_idx = min(start_idx + batch_size, n_samples)
               X_batch = X[start_idx:end_idx]
               y_batch = y[start_idx:end_idx]
               batch_size_actual = X_batch.shape[0]
               Z_batch = X_batch @ W + b
               y_pred_batch = activation_fn(Z_batch)
               error = y_pred_batch - y_batch
               grad_W = (X_batch.T @ error) / batch_size_actual
               grad_b = np.mean(error)
               W = W - lr * grad_W
               b = b - lr * grad_b
           y_pred_full = activation_fn(X @ W + b)
           loss = loss_fn(y_pred_full, y)
           loss_history.append(loss)
           print(f"Epoch {epoch+1}/{num_epochs}, Loss: {loss:.4f}")
       return W, b, loss_history

   X = np.array([[1.0], [2.0], [3.0], [4.0], [5.0], [6.0], [7.0], [8.0]])
   y = np.array([[2.0], [4.0], [6.0], [8.0], [10.0], [12.0], [14.0], [16.0]])
   W_init = np.array([[0.0]])
   b_init = np.array([[0.0]])
   lr = 0.01
   num_epochs = 5
   batch_size = 2
   W_final, b_final, losses = gradient_descent_no_shuffle(X, y, W_init, b_init, lr, num_epochs, batch_size, mse_loss)
   print("Initial weight W:", W_init)
   print("Initial bias b:", b_init)
   print("Final weight W:", W_final)
   print("Final bias b:", b_final)
   print("Loss history:", losses)
   ```

These exercises will help you build intuition for how mini-batch gradient
descent works, the impact of batch size, and the importance of shuffling for
effective training.

## Closing Thoughts

Congratulations on mastering mini-batch gradient descent, a crucial optimization
technique for scalable deep learning! In this post, we’ve extended our
`gradient_descent()` function to process data in mini-batches, making it
efficient for large datasets, and added flexibility with activation functions to
support logistic regression. We’ve also applied it to a binary classification
task on a subset of MNIST, demonstrating real-world applicability with
reasonable training times on a CPU.

In the next chapter (Part 2.4: _Debugging with Numerical Gradients_), we’ll
learn how to verify our gradient computations using numerical methods, ensuring
the correctness of our implementations—a key skill for building reliable deep
