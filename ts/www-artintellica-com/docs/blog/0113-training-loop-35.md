great. now, for each blog post, i am hoping to follow the following structure:

- the course is called "Learn the Training Loop with PyTorch"
- always provide a brief introduction to the topic at hand
- then always provide a very simple "ELI5" explanation of the topic, that
  theortically anyone could understand
- then provide the mathematical foundations. for math, always use dollar
  delimited LaTeX, and always provide a brief explanation of the math. for
  instance, $\mathbf{y} = \mathbf{X}\mathbf{w} + \mathbf{b}$ is the equation for
  linear regression, where $\mathbf{y}$ is the output vector, $\mathbf{X}$ is
  the input matrix, $\mathbf{w}$ is the weight vector, and $\mathbf{b}$ is the
  bias vector.
- for block-level math, always use two dollar signs, like this:
  $$
  \mathbf{y} = \mathbf{X}\mathbf{w} + \mathbf{b}
  $$
- after the mathematical foundations, such as definitions, then always provide
  an in-depth explanation, covering the topic in detail, and expanding on the
  explanation of the math if necessary.
- for other formatting, use markdown like headings, bullet points, and code
  blocks to make the content readable. do not use HTML tags.
- after the math is complete, then provide one or more demonstrations of the
  topic using PyTorch. if possible, always use PyTorch, not numpy, just to keep
  it simple and consistent. you can also use matplotlib to visualize the
  results.
- for all python code, always use type hints, and, if necessary, describe
  installation instructions using "uv" (not pip).
- if you need to use a gpu, note that the user may use apple, or nvidia, or no
- gpu at all, meaning in pytorch you should support cuda or mps or cpu.
- fallback from cuda to mps to cpu.
- then, create a series of exercises, somewhere from 1 - 4 total exercises that
  cover the material. please provide the soruce code for each exercise to make
  sure the student can easily compare their solution to the correct answer. do
  not hide the exercises and do not put HTML in the exercises.
- finally, provide a summary of the topic, and a list of key takeaways.

# Learn the Training Loop with PyTorch  
## Module 3, Post 5: Large-Scale Training — Data Parallelism and Hardware

### Introduction

So far in our journey through the training loop, everything has happened on a single computer, often just using the CPU (or a single GPU, if available). But as machine learning models and datasets have grown, researchers and engineers have needed to run training **faster**, across **multiple GPUs** or even **multiple machines**. This is called **data parallelism**, and it's at the core of modern AI training practices.

In this post, you'll learn:
- Why and how we use multiple GPUs/CPUs (and even multiple machines!) to train models
- What "data parallelism" means in practice
- The hardware involved in large-scale training, from GPUs to clusters
- How you can leverage simple data parallelism in PyTorch with just a few lines of code

## ELI5: Why Train on More Than One Computer (or GPU)?

Imagine you need to teach a class of 1,000 students, but you’re just one teacher—it's going to take a long time! What if you had 10 teachers, all teaching a separate group of 100 students? The job would get done in a fraction of the time, as each teacher works in parallel and shares updates with the rest.

The same idea applies to training machine learning models. If you have a HUGE dataset, you can split it up and let multiple GPUs (the "teachers") each process a slice. Then, they combine what they learned, move on to the next slice, and repeat. This approach is called **data parallelism**.

---

## Mathematical Foundations

Let's formalize this intuition.

Suppose you have a dataset $\mathcal{D} = \{(x_i, y_i)\}_{i=1}^N$ and a model parameterized by $\theta$. The standard mini-batch gradient descent update is:

$$
\theta \leftarrow \theta - \eta \cdot \frac{1}{|\mathcal{B}|} \sum_{(x_i, y_i)\in \mathcal{B}} \nabla_\theta \mathcal{L}(f(x_i; \theta), y_i)
$$

Here,
- $\mathcal{B}$ is a mini-batch, a subset of $\mathcal{D}$
- $f(x_i; \theta)$ is your model's prediction for input $x_i$
- $\mathcal{L}$ is the loss function
- $\eta$ is the learning rate

**In data parallelism**, we divide each batch among *P* parallel workers (GPUs or machines):

Suppose for 4 GPUs:
- Each GPU gets its own mini-batch: $\mathcal{B}_1,\, \mathcal{B}_2,\, \mathcal{B}_3,\, \mathcal{B}_4$
- Each computes its own gradient: $\mathbf{g}_j = \frac{1}{|\mathcal{B}_j|} \sum \nabla_\theta \mathcal{L}(\cdot)$
- All GPUs synchronize and **average** their gradients:
  
  $$
  \mathbf{g}_{\text{avg}} = \frac{1}{4} \sum_{j=1}^4 \mathbf{g}_j
  $$

- **Parameter update** is performed using this average gradient:
  $$
  \theta \leftarrow \theta - \eta \cdot \mathbf{g}_{\text{avg}}
  $$

This averaging ensures the model updates just as if a single giant batch was processed. This is the essence of *data-parallel synchronous SGD.*

## In-Depth Explanation: Data Parallelism & Hardware

### Why GPUs?

CPU cores are great at handling a few complex tasks. GPUs, however, are made for running *thousands* of similar calculations at once—perfect for deep learning, where multiplying huge matrices and applying nonlinearities can all be done in parallel.

Large models and datasets push even one GPU to its limits. That's where *multiple* GPUs (or even *multiple* machines, each with its own GPUs) come in.

### Types of Parallelism

- **Data Parallelism**:  
  - Dataset is split among workers; each computes gradients on different data slices.
  - Gradients are aggregated, then weights are updated synchronously.
- **Model Parallelism** (for really huge models):  
  - Different *layers* or *parts* of the model are run on different devices.
  - We'll focus on **data parallelism** in this post.

### Communication & Synchronization

When multiple GPUs work together, they must **communicate**—usually by sharing gradients after each mini-batch. PyTorch handles this automatically in most settings.

- **Single-machine, multi-GPU**: Fast communication using PCIe/NVLink
- **Multi-node (across multiple computers)**: Communication via high-speed networking (Ethernet, InfiniBand)

### PyTorch & Data Parallelism

PyTorch provides two primary ways to train on multiple GPUs:
1. **`torch.nn.DataParallel`** (easiest, single machine)
2. **`torch.nn.parallel.DistributedDataParallel (DDP)`** (more scalable, for multi-machine setups, but requires setup)

We'll focus on **DataParallel** here, since it's easy to start with.

## PyTorch Demo: Data Parallel Training

Let's see how to use multiple GPUs (if you have them) to train a simple neural network.

> **Installation:**  
> Ensure you have PyTorch and matplotlib:
> ```bash
> uv pip install torch matplotlib
> ```

### 1. Device Selection

First, detect available hardware:

```python
import torch

def get_best_device() -> torch.device:
    if torch.cuda.is_available():
        print("Using CUDA GPU!")
        return torch.device("cuda")
    elif torch.backends.mps.is_available():
        print("Using Apple M1/M2 GPU (MPS)!")
        return torch.device("mps")
    else:
        print("Using CPU.")
        return torch.device("cpu")
```

### 2. Define a Simple Model

```python
import torch.nn as nn

class SimpleNet(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, input_dim: int, hidden_dim: int, output_dim: int) -> None:
        super().__init__()
        self.net = nn.Sequential(
            nn.Linear(input_dim, hidden_dim),
            nn.ReLU(),
            nn.Linear(hidden_dim, output_dim)
        )
    def forward(self, x: torch.Tensor) -> torch.Tensor:
        return self.net(x)
```

### 3. Dummy Dataset

```python
from torch.utils.data import Dataset, DataLoader
import torch

class RandomDataset(Dataset):
    def __init__(self, n_samples: int, input_dim: int) -> None:
        self.X = torch.randn(n_samples, input_dim)
        self.y = (self.X.sum(dim=1, keepdim=True) > 0).float()  # Simple binary target

    def __len__(self) -> int:
        return self.X.shape[0]

    def __getitem__(self, idx: int) -> tuple[torch.Tensor, torch.Tensor]:
        return self.X[idx], self.y[idx]
```

### 4. Training Loop with Data Parallel

```python
import torch.optim as optim

def train_parallel(
    n_gpus: int = 2,  # Number of GPUs to parallelize over (will auto-use available)
    epochs: int = 5,
    batch_size: int = 128
) -> None:
    device = get_best_device()
    dataset = RandomDataset(10_000, input_dim=20)
    dataloader = DataLoader(dataset, batch_size=batch_size, shuffle=True)

    model = SimpleNet(input_dim=20, hidden_dim=64, output_dim=1)
    if torch.cuda.device_count() > 1 and device.type == "cuda":
        print(f"Using DataParallel on {torch.cuda.device_count()} GPUs!")
        model = nn.DataParallel(model)
    model = model.to(device)

    criterion = nn.BCEWithLogitsLoss()
    optimizer = optim.Adam(model.parameters(), lr=0.01)

    for epoch in range(epochs):
        running_loss = 0.0
        for X_batch, y_batch in dataloader:
            X_batch = X_batch.to(device)
            y_batch = y_batch.to(device)
            optimizer.zero_grad()
            outputs = model(X_batch)
            loss = criterion(outputs, y_batch)
            loss.backward()
            optimizer.step()
            running_loss += loss.item() * X_batch.size(0)
        avg_loss = running_loss / len(dataset)
        print(f"Epoch {epoch+1} | Loss: {avg_loss:.4f}")
```

#### Run the Training

```python
if __name__ == "__main__":
    train_parallel()
```

> - On laptops/desktops with 2+ GPUs, this will use both. Otherwise, it'll fall back gracefully to single GPU or CPU.
> - For a *serious* multi-node/multi-machine job, see [PyTorch DistributedDataParallel documentation](https://pytorch.org/tutorials/intermediate/ddp_tutorial.html).

### Visualization: Speedup with Multiple Devices

It's tricky to demo true speedup unless you have multiple GPUs, but you can try timing runs on CPU vs. GPU (if available):

```python
import time

def time_training_on_device(device: torch.device) -> float:
    dataset = RandomDataset(5000, 20)
    dataloader = DataLoader(dataset, batch_size=256)
    model = SimpleNet(20, 64, 1).to(device)
    criterion = nn.BCEWithLogitsLoss()
    optimizer = optim.Adam(model.parameters())
    model.train()
    start = time.time()
    for _ in range(2):  # Just a couple epochs
        for X_batch, y_batch in dataloader:
            X_batch, y_batch = X_batch.to(device), y_batch.to(device)
            optimizer.zero_grad()
            loss = criterion(model(X_batch), y_batch)
            loss.backward()
            optimizer.step()
    end = time.time()
    return end - start

if __name__ == "__main__":
    for device_str in ["cpu", "cuda", "mps"]:
        try:
            device = torch.device(device_str)
            if (device_str == "cuda" and not torch.cuda.is_available()) or \
               (device_str == "mps" and not torch.backends.mps.is_available()):
                continue
            time_taken = time_training_on_device(device)
            print(f"{device_str.upper()}: Training took {time_taken:.2f}s")
        except Exception as e:
            print(f"Skipping {device_str}: {e}")
```

---

## Exercises

### Exercise 1: Test Parallel Training on Your Machine

- Modify the batch size and number of epochs in `train_parallel()` to see how it affects training speed and convergence.
- Try running on CPU and (if you have it) GPU. Compare loss vs. time taken.

#### Reference

Use the `train_parallel()` and `time_training_on_device()` functions above.

---

### Exercise 2: Visualize Gradient Synchronization

- Add a print statement inside the loop, just after `loss.backward()`, showing the `.grad` of the first layer's weights. What do you observe about synchronization when using multiple GPUs (vs. CPU)?

#### Reference

Insert:
```python
print(model.module.net[0].weight.grad if hasattr(model, "module") else model.net[0].weight.grad)
```
right after `loss.backward()`.

---

### Exercise 3: Try a Larger Model

- Modify `SimpleNet` to add a second hidden layer. Does DataParallel still work? (Hint: It should—PyTorch abstracts the parallelism away for you!)

#### Reference

```python
class BiggerNet(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, input_dim: int, hidden_dim: int, output_dim: int) -> None:
        super().__init__()
        self.net = nn.Sequential(
            nn.Linear(input_dim, hidden_dim),
            nn.ReLU(),
            nn.Linear(hidden_dim, hidden_dim),
            nn.ReLU(),
            nn.Linear(hidden_dim, output_dim)
        )
    def forward(self, x: torch.Tensor) -> torch.Tensor:
        return self.net(x)
```
Replace `SimpleNet` with `BiggerNet` in `train_parallel()`.

---

### Exercise 4: *Bonus* — Explore DistributedDataParallel

- If you want an extra challenge and have access to multiple machines or wish to simulate multi-node training, follow the official PyTorch [DDP tutorial](https://pytorch.org/tutorials/intermediate/ddp_tutorial.html).
- Try to set up a minimal script that launches 2 workers (`--nproc_per_node=2`) on a single machine.

---

## Summary

In this post, you learned how training loops can be **scaled up** to handle massive datasets and larger models by splitting work across multiple GPUs or machines. This is *data parallelism*, where each processor handles a piece of the data and synchronizes updates every step, making training both **faster** and **scalable**.

PyTorch’s tools make this easy, letting you use DataParallel on a single machine or DistributedDataParallel for clusters, with minimal code changes.

---

## Key Takeaways

- **Data parallelism** splits batches among parallel processors (GPUs, CPUs, or nodes), synchronizing gradients each iteration.
- **Hardware matters:** More GPUs means faster model training (up to a point).
- **PyTorch’s DataParallel** makes multi-GPU use nearly seamless for single-machine setups.
- **Distributed training** (across multiple servers) is standard for the world’s largest models, leveraging sophisticated distributed hardware and networks.
- The core training loop logic stays almost exactly the same, thanks to the abstractions provided.
- Always be hardware-aware: not all machines have GPUs (or the same kind), so code should gracefully fall back to CPU if needed.

Congratulations! You now grasp the backbone of *large-scale* machine learning and how the same training loop can scale from your laptop to gigantic clusters powering today’s AI breakthroughs.
