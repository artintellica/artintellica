# Learn the Training Loop with PyTorch  
## Module 2.2: Forward and Backward Passes

### Introduction

Welcome back to *Learn the Training Loop with PyTorch*!

In this post, we'll explore two essential concepts at the heart of neural network training: the **forward pass** and the **backward pass**. These steps are the backbone of how neural networks learn from data. We'll also introduce the **chain rule**—a simple but crucial mathematical tool that powers backpropagation, the algorithm that helps neural networks adjust their weights and get smarter with each step.

---

### ELI5: Forward and Backward Passes

- **Forward Pass:** Imagine a factory assembly line—data comes in, and at each station (layer), it’s processed, until we get an output (like a finished product). In neural networks, this means feeding an input through the network to produce a prediction.
  
- **Backward Pass:** Now, after seeing how good or bad the prediction is (using a loss function), we want to improve the factory. The backward pass is like tracking back through each station and figuring out how much each needs to be tweaked to reduce errors next time. This is done by calculating *gradients*—essentially, how much each parameter (weight) affects the error.

---

### Mathematical Foundations

#### The Forward Pass

For a simple neural network (say, one hidden layer), each layer performs:
$$
\mathbf{z}^{(1)} = \mathbf{X}\mathbf{W}^{(1)} + \mathbf{b}^{(1)}
$$
$$
\mathbf{a}^{(1)} = \sigma(\mathbf{z}^{(1)})
$$
$$
\mathbf{z}^{(2)} = \mathbf{a}^{(1)}\mathbf{W}^{(2)} + \mathbf{b}^{(2)}
$$
$$
\mathbf{\hat{y}} = \mathbf{z}^{(2)}
$$

- $\mathbf{X}$: input data
- $\mathbf{W}^{(1)},\ \mathbf{W}^{(2)}$: weights for layers 1 and 2
- $\mathbf{b}^{(1)},\ \mathbf{b}^{(2)}$: bias vectors
- $\sigma$: activation function (like ReLU or sigmoid)
- $\mathbf{\hat{y}}$: predicted output

#### The Chain Rule

Suppose you have functions "nested" inside each other:
$$
y = f(g(x))
$$
The chain rule allows us to compute the derivative of $y$ with respect to $x$:
$$
\frac{dy}{dx} = f'(g(x)) \cdot g'(x)
$$
This rule allows us to work backwards through each layer to compute how the loss changes with each model parameter.

#### The Backward Pass (Backpropagation)

The backward pass computes gradients of the loss function with respect to each weight and bias (using the chain rule), so parameters can be updated (typically by **gradient descent**). For a loss function $\mathcal{L}$:
$$
\frac{\partial \mathcal{L}}{\partial \mathbf{W}} = ?
$$

For each layer, gradients are **backpropagated** from the output towards the input, using partial derivatives.

#### Why Does This Matter?

*To improve a model, we need to know how changing each parameter will affect its predictions. The chain rule gives us an efficient way to systematically calculate all these effects, no matter how deep the network.*

---

### In-Depth Explanation

#### The Forward Pass: Data Flows In

- Input vectors are fed into the network.
- Every layer processes its inputs: multiplies by weights, adds biases, passes through activation functions.
- Final output (the prediction) is produced.

Example:
Suppose we have an image, and a neural net predicts whether it's a cat or a dog. The forward pass is the act of generating that prediction from pixel values.

#### The Backward Pass: Gradients Flow Out

- After we compute the loss (a measure of how "bad" our prediction was), we want to adjust our weights to do better next time.
- The backward pass calculates **how much each weight and bias contributed to the error**.
- This process repeatedly applies the chain rule:
    - For each layer (starting from the output layer), we compute the gradient of the loss with respect to its parameters.
    - We use these gradients to update model parameters using an optimizer (like SGD or Adam).

#### A Simple Example: Two-Layer Network

Imagine you have the following sequence:
$$
\text{Input} \xrightarrow{\mathbf{W}^{(1)},\ \mathbf{b}^{(1)}} \text{Hidden} \xrightarrow{\text{ReLU}} \xrightarrow{\mathbf{W}^{(2)},\ \mathbf{b}^{(2)}} \text{Output}
$$

During *forward*, all we do is plug the input in and calculate the output.

During *backward*, let's say our output was too high. The backward pass figures out:
- Was it because $\mathbf{W}^{(2)}$ was too large? Or maybe $\mathbf{W}^{(1)}$?
- It breaks down the error gradient for each parameter.
- Optimizer *nudges* weights and biases in the right direction to reduce the loss next time.

*Backpropagation* is just the systematic application of the chain rule so we can efficiently update all parameters, no matter how many layers we have.

---

### PyTorch Demonstration

Let's see this in practice with PyTorch. We'll build a tiny neural network, make a dummy prediction, and watch the gradients flow!

#### Installation (if needed)

```bash
uv pip install torch matplotlib
```

#### Example Code: Forward and Backward in PyTorch

```python
import torch
from torch import nn
from typing import Tuple

# Set manual seed for reproducible results
torch.manual_seed(0)

# Define a simple feedforward neural network with 1 hidden layer
class SimpleNN(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, input_dim: int, hidden_dim: int, output_dim: int):
        super().__init__()
        self.layer1 = nn.Linear(input_dim, hidden_dim)
        self.activation = nn.ReLU()
        self.layer2 = nn.Linear(hidden_dim, output_dim)

    def forward(self, x: torch.Tensor) -> torch.Tensor:
        x = self.layer1(x)
        x = self.activation(x)
        x = self.layer2(x)
        return x

# Dummy data: 2 samples, 3 features each
X = torch.tensor([[1.0, 2.0, 3.0], [4.0, 5.0, 6.0]])
y_true = torch.tensor([[10.0], [20.0]])

# Instantiate the network
model = SimpleNN(input_dim=3, hidden_dim=4, output_dim=1)

# Forward Pass
y_pred = model(X)
print('Predictions:', y_pred.detach().numpy())

# Compute loss (Mean Squared Error)
criterion = nn.MSELoss()
loss = criterion(y_pred, y_true)
print('Loss:', loss.item())

# Backward Pass
model.zero_grad()     # Clears old gradients
loss.backward()       # Computes gradients

# Inspect gradients
print('Gradient of layer1 weights:')
print(model.layer1.weight.grad)
print('Gradient of layer2 weights:')
print(model.layer2.weight.grad)
```

**What’s happening above?**
- First, we create a mini neural net with one hidden layer (`layer1`).
- We run two simple data points through the model (forward pass).
- We compute the loss.
- `.backward()` backpropagates the error, populating `.grad` attributes of the parameters via the chain rule!
- We print the gradients—these tell us how to update our weights during training.

---

### Exercises

#### Exercise 1: Manually Step through Forward and Backward Pass

Write your own code to:
1. Create an input tensor of your choice (shape `(1, 3)`).
2. Pass it through the model.
3. Compute the loss with respect to your chosen target.
4. Perform backward pass.
5. Print the gradients.

**Solution:**
```python
# 1. Input and target
X = torch.tensor([[7.0, 8.0, 9.0]])
y_true = torch.tensor([[30.0]])

# 2. Forward pass
y_pred = model(X)

# 3. Compute loss
loss = criterion(y_pred, y_true)

# 4. Backward pass
model.zero_grad()
loss.backward()

# 5. Print gradients
print('Grad for layer1:', model.layer1.weight.grad)
print('Grad for layer2:', model.layer2.weight.grad)
```

---

#### Exercise 2: Visualize How Loss Changes with Manual Weight Tweaks

Pick a single parameter in layer 2, slightly adjust its value, run a forward pass, and plot how the loss changes.

**Solution:**
```python
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Grab original weight and clone for restoration
original_weight = model.layer2.weight.data.clone()
weights = []
losses = []

for delta in torch.linspace(-2, 2, steps=50):
    # change just the first entry in layer2 weights
    model.layer2.weight.data[0,0] = original_weight[0,0] + delta
    y_pred = model(X)
    loss = criterion(y_pred, y_true)
    weights.append(model.layer2.weight.data[0,0].item())
    losses.append(loss.item())

# Restore original weight
model.layer2.weight.data[0,0] = original_weight[0,0]

plt.plot(weights, losses)
plt.xlabel('layer2.weight[0,0] value')
plt.ylabel('Loss')
plt.title('Effect of changing a single weight on loss')
plt.show()
```

---

### Summary

- The **forward pass** sends input data through the network to get predictions.
- The **backward pass** starts from the loss and measures how much each network parameter contributed to the error, by calculating *gradients*.
- The **chain rule** of calculus lets us efficiently compute these gradients even for deep, complex networks—a process called **backpropagation**.
- PyTorch automates these steps using its computational graph and the `.backward()` method.

---

### Key Takeaways

- **Forward pass:** data flows forward to make a prediction.
- **Backward pass:** errors flow backward; gradients measure sensitivity of loss to each parameter.
- **Chain rule:** the fuel behind backpropagation; breaks complex derivatives into manageable pieces.
- **PyTorch's autograd:** automatically handles all math for derivatives and backward passes!
- Understanding these steps gives you deep insight into *how* and *why* neural networks learn.

Next time, we’ll build on this knowledge and hand-code a simple neural network from scratch!

**USER:**

i have a question about weights and biases. how are the initial weights and biases determined? are they random?

**ASSISTANT:**

Great question!

## Initialization of Weights and Biases in Neural Networks

**TL;DR:**  
Weights in neural networks are usually initialized **randomly** (but in a controlled way), and biases are often initialized to zeros or small constants. This randomness is crucial for training, and the specific method can impact learning speed and model performance.

---

### ELI5 Explanation

- **Think of initial weights like the starting positions in a "treasure hunt":**  
  If everyone started at the same spot (say, all weights = 0), they'd all take the same path and never learn uniquely useful information.
- By starting from different (random) positions, the neurons in the network learn to detect **different patterns** in the data.

---

### Common Methods

#### Weights

- **Random Initialization:**  
  Each weight is set to a small random value (not always *just* random; see below).

- **Why not all zeros?**  
  If all weights are zero, every neuron in a layer behaves identically. This is called the **symmetry problem**—no individual neuron can learn something unique.

- **Popular Schemes:**
  - **Uniform or normal distribution:**  
    $$ w \sim \mathcal{U}(-a, a) \quad \text{or} \quad \mathcal{N}(0, \sigma^2) $$
  - **Xavier/Glorot initialization** (for tanh, sigmoid):  
    $$ w \sim \mathcal{U}\left(-\frac{\sqrt{6}}{\sqrt{n_{in} + n_{out}}}, \frac{\sqrt{6}}{\sqrt{n_{in} + n_{out}}}\right) $$
  - **Kaiming/He initialization** (for ReLU):  
    $$ w \sim \mathcal{N}\left(0, \frac{2}{n_{in}}\right) $$
    - $n_{in}$ = number of input connections

#### Biases

- **Usually Initialized to Zero:**  
  Biases **don't have the symmetry issue** that weights have, so it’s safe (and common) to initialize all biases to $0$ or to a small constant.

---

### PyTorch Example

Here’s how PyTorch handles this under the hood:

```python
layer = torch.nn.Linear(in_features=10, out_features=5)
print("Initial weights:", layer.weight)
print("Initial biases:", layer.bias)
```

- `torch.nn.Linear` layers use Kaiming Uniform by default for weights.
- Biases are initialized to zeros.

---

### Key Takeaways

- **Weights:** Randomized (with statistical care!) to break symmetry and ensure diversity in learning.
- **Biases:** Often zeros or small constants; no need for randomness.
- Initialization strategy **matters**: Good initial values make training faster and more stable, while poor initialization can slow or even prevent learning.

---

*If you're curious about customizing initialization in PyTorch, just ask!*

**USER:**

on each backwards pass, are all weights and biases updated?


**ASSISTANT:**

**Great question!**  
In nearly all standard neural network training (including with PyTorch), **yes**:  
> **On each backward pass, all trainable weights and biases in the network receive gradient updates.**

---

### Step-by-Step Breakdown

1. **Forward Pass:**
   - The network computes the output and the loss for the current batch of data.

2. **Backward Pass:**
   - The network computes **gradients** of the loss with respect to every trainable parameter (weights and biases) using backpropagation.
   - Mathematically, for each parameter $\theta$,
     $$
     \frac{\partial \mathcal{L}}{\partial \theta}
     $$
     gets calculated, where $\mathcal{L}$ is the loss.

3. **Parameter Update:**
   - The optimizer (e.g., SGD, Adam) uses these gradients to **update every parameter** (weight and bias) that *requires gradients*.
   - Example update rule (for gradient descent):
     $$
     \theta \leftarrow \theta - \eta \cdot \frac{\partial \mathcal{L}}{\partial \theta}
     $$
     where $\eta$ is the learning rate.

---

### Are There Any Exceptions?

- **If you freeze parameters:**  
  Parameters with `requires_grad=False` (e.g., in transfer learning) won't receive gradients and won't be updated.
- **Some layers (like BatchNorm/Dropout):**  
  Have parameters that may or may not be updated depending on how they're set up.
- **Optimizers can target only some parameters:**  
  But in a typical freshly built network, **all weights and biases are included.**

---

### PyTorch Example

```python
for param in model.parameters():
    print(param.requires_grad)  # Default is True (so all will be updated)
```

- All `True`? All will be updated.

---

### Key Takeaway

> **By default, every weight and bias in the network is updated on every backward pass.**

If you want to "freeze" some layers or parameters (not update them), you set `.requires_grad = False` for those parameters.

Let me know if you want an example on how to freeze specific weights or layers!

**USER:**

i'm still confused about stochastic gradient descent vs. mini-batch gradient descent. in both cases, are all weights and biases updated on each backward pass?

**ASSISTANT:**

Fantastic question! This is something a lot of learners wonder about.

## Stochastic Gradient Descent vs. Mini-Batch Gradient Descent

### Definitions

- **Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD):**  
  Each update uses **one** training sample.
  
- **Mini-batch Gradient Descent:**  
  Each update uses a **small batch** of samples (e.g., 32 or 64 at a time).

### What These Algorithms Control

**The main difference is how much data they use to compute the loss and gradients for each parameter update.**  
- **SGD:** computes gradients based on just ONE data point.
- **Mini-batch:** computes gradients as the average over several data points.

### Do All Weights and Biases Get Updated in Each Case?

**Yes! In both cases:**
> **On each backward pass, all weights and biases in the model (that require gradients) are updated, regardless of how many samples are in the batch.**

**The only difference:**  
- The *batch size* determines how the loss and gradients are computed,
- But the result is still a gradient for *every* parameter, and *every* parameter gets updated on that step.

### A Visual Analogy

- Imagine every update as *tugging* every knob (parameter) a little bit—sometimes based on noisy, single-sample feedback (SGD), sometimes on a more stable average opinion (mini-batch).
- *But you’re tugging every knob every time!*

### How It Looks in PyTorch

```python
# Data loader (mini-batch of size 32)
for X_batch, y_batch in dataloader:
    optimizer.zero_grad()
    y_pred = model(X_batch)
    loss = criterion(y_pred, y_batch)
    loss.backward()
    optimizer.step()
    # -> All parameters get updated here

# For true SGD, you set batch_size=1 in the DataLoader.
```

### Summary Table

| Method             | Samples per update | Gradients/Step | Parameters updated per step |
|--------------------|-------------------|----------------|----------------------------|
| SGD                | 1                 | per-sample     | All                        |
| Mini-batch GD      | N (e.g., 32)      | average        | All                        |

---

## Key Point

**No matter the batch size, every weight and bias gets updated each backward pass—just with gradients computed from different amounts of data.**

If you’re curious about the real effect of batch size, it’s mostly about how “noisy” those gradients are, and the speed/efficiency of training—not about what gets updated!

---

*Still have questions about batching, data loaders, or parameter updates? I’m happy to keep exploring!*

**USER:**

so, in mini-batch and SGD, we are not using the full matrix X of data, correct? but we are nonetheless updating all weights and biases in the model, right? and in full batch, we are using the full matrix X, and we are also updating all weights and biases in the model, right?

**ASSISTANT:**

Absolutely correct! Here’s a concise breakdown:

---

## 1. Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD)
- **Data used per update:** **One** sample (a single row/vector from $\mathbf{X}$).
- **Weights/biases updated:** **All** weights and biases are updated **each step**.
- **$\mathbf{X}$ used:** Only one row at a time, not the full matrix.

## 2. Mini-batch Gradient Descent
- **Data used per update:** **A small batch** of samples from $\mathbf{X}$ (e.g., 32, 64 rows at a time).
- **Weights/biases updated:** **All** weights and biases are updated **each step**.
- **$\mathbf{X}$ used:** Only a slice (a batch) at a time, not the full matrix.

## 3. Full-Batch Gradient Descent
- **Data used per update:** **The full dataset** $\mathbf{X}$ (all rows).
- **Weights/biases updated:** **All** weights and biases are updated **each step**.
- **$\mathbf{X}$ used:** The **entire** matrix is used for one giant step.

---

### Table Summary

| Method         | Data used per update       | All weights/biases updated per step? |
|----------------|---------------------------|--------------------------------------|
| SGD            | One sample                | YES                                  |
| Mini-batch GD  | Small batch (e.g., 32)    | YES                                  |
| Full-batch GD  | All data ($X$)            | YES                                  |

---

### Key Point

> **No matter the batch size** (1, mini-batch, or full batch):  
> - You always update **all weights and all biases** after each backward pass.
> - The difference is just *how much of your data* you use to compute the gradients for that step.

---

Let me know if you want a visual demo or PyTorch code illustrating these differences!

**USER:**

how many weights and biases are there for large models, like modern LLMs? presumably the data, X, is truly enormous, such as all internet text data. but also, if all weights and biases are updated on each backward pass, this presumably fits into a single computer, or maybe a single cluster of computers. how big are the weights and biases in these models?

**ASSISTANT:**

Outstanding series of questions! Let’s break it down step by step:

---

## 1. **How Many Weights and Biases in Large LLMs?**

Modern large language models (LLMs) like GPT-3, GPT-4, or Google's PaLM have **billions to trillions of parameters**.  
**Parameters** = **weights** + **biases** (and sometimes other learnable values, like in layer norm).

- **GPT-3 (175B):**  
  ~175 billion parameters
- **GPT-4:**  
  Number not fully public, but possibly **trillions** according to some estimates
- **PaLM (540B):**  
  ~540 billion parameters

A small BERT base model for reference:
- **BERT base:** ~110 million parameters

---

## 2. **How Large is That in Memory?**

Let’s estimate for GPT-3:

- **175,000,000,000 parameters**
- Typically stored as float32 or float16:
    - **float32:** 4 bytes each
    - **float16:** 2 bytes each

**In float16 (common in large models):**
$$
175 \text{ billion} \times 2 \text{ bytes} = 350 \text{ GB}
$$

**In float32:**
$$
175 \text{ billion} \times 4 \text{ bytes} = 700 \text{ GB}
$$

*That’s just for weights—other memory is needed for activations, gradients, optimizer states, etc.*

---

## 3. **How Big is $X$ (the Data)?**

- The training dataset for models like GPT-3 is on the order of **hundreds of billions of words**—essentially a filtered snapshot of the publicly available internet, books, Wikipedia, coding repositories, etc.
- The entire raw dataset could be **terabytes to tens of terabytes** in size, but **you don’t feed all of $X$** into the model at once. You use **mini-batches**.

---

## 4. **How Do They Fit the Model and Training on Hardware?**

- **All model weights and biases must be accessible for updating on each backward pass.**
- For LLMs, **the set of weights doesn’t fit on a single GPU** (which typically has 80GB or less of memory).
- **Solution: Model parallelism and distributed training:**  
  - **Parameters are split across multiple GPUs/TPUs/servers**—each only stores and updates a "slice" of the entire set.
  - **Communication black-magic:** Specialized software ensures gradients are shared and weights are updated together.
- **Data parallelism:**  
  - Multiple batches are trained simultaneously on different slices of data, then their gradients are averaged.

- **Training LLMs often require thousands of high-end GPUs working together for weeks or months.**

---

## 5. **Key Points**

- **Weights/biases in LLMs number in the hundreds of billions or more.**
- **Raw dataset $X$ is huge, but only small batches (mini-batches) are used per training step.**
- All weights/biases **are updated every step** (for every mini-batch), but they are often split up (sharded) across many devices for parallel training.
- **You cannot fit all weights and all of $X$ into a single GPU or standard computer in these scenarios.**  
  Instead, large clusters act as a single “virtual super-computer.”

#### **Summary**

- **LLMs have hundreds of billions or more weights/biases.**
- **All are updated each step,** but are distributed across huge clusters.
- **The training data $X$ is enormous, but only a tiny slice is used for each backward pass.**

*Want to know more about distributed/model parallelism or how this is implemented in PyTorch? Just ask!*

**USER:**

ok, so although all weights and biases might not fit on a single computer at a time, they are still held in memory on a computing cluster of some kind, because on every backwards pass, every weight and bias is updated, correct? presumably, every update, they are saved to disk, so that they are saved in case the computers crash.

**ASSISTANT:**

**You’ve got it exactly right!**  
Let’s clarify the process for large models like LLMs:

---

## **Where Are Weights and Biases Stored?**

- **During training:**  
  - **All weights and biases must be present in memory** (RAM or GPU memory) _somewhere_ in the computing cluster so that gradients can be calculated and updates performed.
  - In the case of LLMs, these parameters are **partitioned ("sharded") across many GPUs and/or nodes**, so that each machine is responsible for a slice of the total parameters.
  - **Each backward pass**: The necessary synchronization/communication ensures that every parameter gets its gradient computed and updated, even though no single node may have all parameters at once.

---

## **What about persistent storage (saving to disk)?**

- **Checkpoints:**  
  - During training, models are **routinely saved to disk** ("checkpointing"). This often happens every few minutes, hours, or after a certain number of steps/epochs.
  - Checkpoints include:
      - All weights and biases (and sometimes optimizer state, learning rate schedule, etc).
      - This way, if training halts (crash, power outage, maintenance), it can resume from the last checkpoint.

- **Why not update disk every step?**
  - **Updating to disk every backward pass would be way too slow**—writing hundreds of GB or even TBs to disk at each step would grind training to a halt.
  - So, weight/bias updates are performed "in memory" (across the cluster) each step, and **periodically written to disk**.

---

## **What happens if something crashes?**

- **If a crash occurs, training resumes from the most recent checkpoint.**  
  Some progress may be lost, but not everything.

---

## **Key Points**

- **All weights/biases are present and updated in memory during each backward pass,** even if they're split across hundreds or thousands of machines.
- **They’re not saved to disk every update, but are checkpointed regularly** to protect against catastrophic failure.
- **Each update requires all parameters to be available somewhere in memory** (spread across the computing cluster), so gradients and updates can happen for all parameters.

---

### *Summary Statement*

> On every backward pass, **all weights and biases are in memory across the computing cluster and are updated in place**.  
> **Checkpointing** to disk is done at intervals (not every step), so training can resume if there’s a failure.
