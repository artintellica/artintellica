i need your help with a project. i am learning machine learning, and i am doing it in a unique way. i am writing an open source blog called Artintellica. i have already gone through linear algebra, calculus, and deep learning. i am now moving onto reinforcement learning.

the way it works is that i am creating a series of blog posts for each subject. each blog post has math, python examples, and exercises in python. although some subjects are very mathematicaly, we never have purely math exercises. instead, we always have python code exercises.

the next thing i am doing is reinforcement learning. the basic idea for this course is to learn reinforcement learning with pytorch. we will be starting with elemtnary matrices and vectors, and then moving onto more advanced subjects including neural networks, reinforcement learning, and deep reinforcement learning.

i need your help to product the first blog post. each blog post should always start with front-matter, which looks like this:

+++
title = "Learn Reinforcement Learning with PyTorch, Part N.M: [the title of the blog post]"
author = "Artintellica"
date = "2025-06-09" [or whatever the date is]
+++

for each blog post, always give an explanation of the subject at hand. whenever necessary, use mathematics, including definitions and perhaps occassionally mathematical proofs. be sure to include introductory and concluding sections. the basic structure of each blog post should be something like this:

- introduction
- mathematics (if necessary)
- python demonstrations with full code
- python exercises for the reader to try
- conclusion

for all python code, always use python type hints wherever possible. and if you need to give installation instructions, use uv.

now i will proceed to give you the outline. can you please respond by writing the first blog post? please respond with the blog post only. oh, and be sure that for all math you do, you always do dollar-denominated math. use one dollar symbol for inline math, and two dollar symbols for display math.

the outline is as follows:

date = "2024-06-09"
+++

Welcome! This is the first entry in **Artintellica's Reinforcement Learning series**—a practical, code-driven open-source course where we build mathematical foundations and RL agents **from vectors to deep Q-networks, all with PyTorch**. Whether you've found us via GitHub, search, or your love of math and code, *thank you*. This blog is intended for ambitious beginners who want more than a "black box" approach.

What sets this course apart?

- **Code-first:** Every exercise uses Python, and everything is done in code—even math.
- **Open source:** Every post, example, and dataset is MIT licensed. Fork, modify, use!
- **Math-backed:** We'll use mathematics where appropriate—but always paired with concrete, hands-on coding.
- **PyTorch-powered:** PyTorch is now the dominant RL and deep learning research tool, with a gentle learning curve, intuitive tensor ops, and blazing performance on CPUs and GPUs.

**This first post** serves as both an orientation and your first hands-on steps: installing PyTorch, running "Hello Tensors", and manipulating your first data structures.

---

## What Will You Learn?

This post will help you:

- Understand how this RL course is structured (and what comes next)
- Install PyTorch on your system using the `uv` package manager
- Create and manipulate your first `torch.Tensor` objects
- Move tensors between CPU and GPU (if available)
- Run and interpret your first PyTorch computation

Each concept comes with code and hands-on exercises. By the end, you'll be ready for the math and code engine that powers everything in modern deep learning (and, soon, RL!).

---

## Why PyTorch? Why Not Just Numpy?

PyTorch is a numeric computation library like NumPy, but with several important differences that make it essential for modern ML and RL:

1. **Automatic Differentiation:** Critical for optimization and training models.
2. **Hardware Acceleration:** Fast computation on CPUs, GPUs (CUDA), and Apple Silicon (MPS) with almost no code changes.
3. **Dynamic Graphs:** Models can be defined and modified "on the fly", perfect for research and RL.
4. **Neural Network Utilities:** Everything from layers to RL-specific frameworks.
5. **Community & Ecosystem:** Used everywhere—if you can do it in deep RL, you can probably do it in PyTorch.

Throughout this course, you'll see how PyTorch lets us build RL agents—from table-based to neural-based—with minimal friction.

---

## Mathematics: How PyTorch Relates to Vectors and Matrices

At its core, PyTorch's **Tensor** object generalizes the matrix and vector concepts from linear algebra. In this blog, everything you learned about scalars ($a$), vectors ($\mathbf{x}$), and matrices ($A$) will correspond directly to PyTorch `Tensor` objects—uniquely enabling you to:

- Write code that *is* the math
- Run experiments interactively
- Train and debug agents at every complexity level

We'll often use math notation ($\mathbf{x}$, $A$, etc.) side-by-side with its exact code representation (`torch.Tensor`). As you encounter concepts like dot product, matrix multiplication, or vector norms, we'll show both the formula and its PyTorch incarnation.

---

## Installing PyTorch (with `uv`)

> ℹ️ For this blog, we'll assume you use Python 3.9 or later on Linux, macOS, or Windows. Use VS Code, Jupyter, or any Python IDE you like.

We recommend [uv](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv) for fast, reproducible, modern package management.

### **Step 1:** Install `uv` (if not already installed)

```sh
pip install --upgrade uv
```

### **Step 2:** Create a new project directory and initialize

```sh
mkdir rl-with-pytorch && cd rl-with-pytorch
uv venv
source .venv/bin/activate  # or .venv\Scripts\activate on Windows
```

### **Step 3:** Install PyTorch + matplotlib (for plots)

Find your install command at: [https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/](https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/).

For most CPU-only systems:

```sh
uv pip install torch torchvision torchaudio matplotlib
```

For CUDA-enabled GPUs, use the correct `torch` version:

```sh
uv pip install torch torchvision torchaudio --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu121
uv pip install matplotlib
```

### **Verify Installation**

Open Python:

```python
import torch
print("Torch version:", torch.__version__)
print(torch.rand(2, 2))
```

If this prints the version and a $2\times 2$ tensor of random numbers, you're ready!

---

## Python Demonstrations

Let's walk through key tensor operations.

### **Demo 1: Create a Tensor and Print Its Data, Shape, dtype**

```python
import torch

# Create a 1D tensor of floats, from 0 to 4
x: torch.Tensor = torch.arange(5, dtype=torch.float32)
print("x:", x)  # Tensor data
print("Shape:", x.shape)
print("Dtype:", x.dtype)
```

### **Demo 2: Move Tensor to GPU (if available) or MPS (Apple Silicon)**

```python
# Detect GPUs or MPS device (Apple Silicon)
if torch.cuda.is_available():
    device: torch.device = torch.device("cuda")
elif getattr(torch, "has_mps", False) and torch.backends.mps.is_available():
    device = torch.device("mps")
else:
    device = torch.device("cpu")
print(f"Using device: {device}")

x_gpu: torch.Tensor = x.to(device)
print("x is on device:", x_gpu.device)
```

### **Demo 3: "Hello World"—Elementwise Addition**

Elementwise addition is just like with math or NumPy: $z_i = x_i + y_i$

```python
y: torch.Tensor = torch.ones(5, dtype=torch.float32, device=device)
z: torch.Tensor = x_gpu + y  # elementwise add
print("z:", z)
```

---

## Exercises

Try these yourself! (Start from a new Python file, or use a Jupyter notebook.)

### **Exercise 1:** Install PyTorch and Verify

- Install using `uv` as above. Write Python code to import `torch` and print its version.

### **Exercise 2:** Create Your First Tensor

- Create a tensor of shape `(4, 3)` (4 rows, 3 cols) filled with random numbers.

- Move a tensor to CPU, then to device, and print its `.device` at each stage.

### **Exercise 4:** Hello World Addition

- Create two tensors of size `(6,)` (one with all zeros, one with all ones).
- Add them and print the result.

---

**Sample Starter Code for Exercises:**

```python
import torch

# EXERCISE 1
print("PyTorch version:", torch.__version__)

# EXERCISE 2

b = b.to(device)
print("After:", b.device)

# EXERCISE 4
zero: torch.Tensor = torch.zeros(6)
one: torch.Tensor = torch.ones(6)
sum_: torch.Tensor = zero + one
print("Sum:", sum_)
```

## Introduction

Welcome back to Artintellica’s open-source RL course! After setting up PyTorch and running your first tensor operations, it’s time to ground ourselves in the basics: **vectors and scalars**. Tensors are the backbone of all computations in PyTorch and reinforcement learning. Understanding how to create, reshape, and manipulate these 1D (and 0D) structures is crucial whether you’re implementing bandits, processing observations, or building neural networks.

In this post, we’ll:

- See how **scalars** (single numbers) and **vectors** (1D arrays) arise in both mathematics and PyTorch.
- Learn how to create and reshape tensors, index and slice them, and compute basic statistics.
- Visualize vectors as sequences—an essential skill for debugging neural networks and RL environments.
- Provide hands-on coding exercises so you have full mastery before moving on to matrices (next time).

Let’s get started!

---

## Mathematics: Scalars and Vectors

Mathematically,

- A **scalar** is a single number, $a \in \mathbb{R}$ (for example, the reward at a particular step).
- A **vector** is a one-dimensional array of numbers, $\mathbf{x} = [x_1, x_2, \ldots, x_n]^\top$, where $n$ is the number of elements (for example, an agent’s observation or a parameter vector).

In PyTorch:

- **Scalar tensor:** A tensor of zero dimensions (`torch.tensor(3.0)`)
- **Vector tensor:** A tensor with shape `(n,)` for $n$ elements, i.e., `torch.tensor([1.0, 2.0, 3.0])`

PyTorch allows you to reshape, index, slice, and analyze these with almost NumPy-like power—plus GPU acceleration.

---

## Demonstrations: Cooking with Scalars and Vectors

### Creating and Reshaping Scalars & Vectors

```python
import torch

# Scalar (0-dimensional tensor, holds a single value)
a: torch.Tensor = torch.tensor(7.5)
print("Scalar a:", a)
print("Shape (should be torch.Size([])):", a.shape)
print("Dimensions (should be 0):", a.dim())

# 1-D vector tensor
v: torch.Tensor = torch.tensor([1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0])
print("Vector v:", v)
print("Shape:", v.shape)
print("Dimensions:", v.dim())

# Changing shape: Reshape vector v to a column vector (n, 1)
v_col: torch.Tensor = v.unsqueeze(1)  # adds a new dimension at position 1
print("v as column vector (shape):", v_col.shape)

# Flatten v_col back to 1D
v_flat: torch.Tensor = v_col.squeeze()
print("v_col squeezed to 1D:", v_flat.shape)
```

### Indexing, Slicing, and Reversing

```python
# Indexing: Get the second element (index 1)
second: torch.Tensor = v[1]
print("Second element:", second.item())  # .item() to extract Python float

# Slicing: Get the first three elements
first_three: torch.Tensor = v[:3]
print("First three elements:", first_three)

# Reversing the vector
reversed_v: torch.Tensor = v.flip(0)
print("Reversed v:", reversed_v)
```

### Basic Statistics: Mean, Sum, Std

```python
# Compute statistics
mean_v: torch.Tensor = v.mean()
sum_v: torch.Tensor = v.sum()
std_v: torch.Tensor = v.std(unbiased=False)  # Match numpy's normalization

print(f"Mean: {mean_v.item():.2f}")
print(f"Sum: {sum_v.item():.2f}")
print(f"Std: {std_v.item():.2f}")
```

### Plotting Vectors with Matplotlib

For visualization (so important in RL diagnostics!), let’s plot a vector as a line graph.

```python
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Let's create a vector of sine values
t: torch.Tensor = torch.linspace(0, 2 * torch.pi, 100)
sin_t: torch.Tensor = torch.sin(t)

plt.figure(figsize=(8, 4))
plt.plot(t.numpy(), sin_t.numpy())
plt.title("Sine Wave")
plt.xlabel("t")
plt.ylabel("sin(t)")
plt.grid(True)
plt.show()
```

## Conclusion

Today, you’ve gained hands-on experience with the two most fundamental building blocks in PyTorch and RL—scalars and vectors. You learned to create, reshape, index, reverse, compute statistics, and even plot them. Mastery of these basics makes everything to come—matrix math, neural networks, and reinforcement learning algorithms—much easier and more intuitive.

**In the next post**, we will extend these skills to *vector operations*: addition, scaling, and dot products. Being comfortable with tensors, dimensions, and slicing will let you focus on building and debugging RL agents instead of being tripped up by tensor shapes!

*Keep practicing, play with your own vectors, and see you in Part 1.3!*

# === USER ===

i have a question about the relationship of numpy to pytorch. in numpy, i don't remember having to deal with the distinction between column vectors and row vectors. did i miss something, or does pytorch make it possible to have both column and row vectors?

# === ASSISTANT ===

I'm glad you asked about the relationship between NumPy and PyTorch, as well as the distinction between column and row vectors. Let’s clarify this with a detailed explanation.

### NumPy and PyTorch: Similarities and Differences in Handling Vectors

**NumPy** and **PyTorch** are both powerful libraries for numerical computation, and they share many similarities in how they handle arrays (or tensors, in PyTorch terminology). However, there are key differences in their design and functionality, especially when it comes to vector representations and their shapes.

#### NumPy Vectors
In NumPy, a 1D array (e.g., `np.array([1, 2, 3])`) is neither explicitly a row vector nor a column vector in terms of its internal representation. NumPy’s 1D arrays are simply sequences of values with a shape like `(3,)`, and they are agnostic to the row/column distinction. This means:

- A 1D NumPy array can be thought of as a "flat" vector, and its interpretation as a row or column vector often depends on the context of the operation (e.g., matrix multiplication).
- When performing operations like matrix multiplication with `np.dot` or `@`, NumPy will implicitly treat a 1D array as a row or column vector based on the dimensions of the other operand to make the operation valid. For example:
  ```python
  import numpy as np
  v = np.array([1, 2, 3])
  M = np.array([[1, 0, 0], [0, 1, 0], [0, 0, 1]])
  result = M @ v  # v is treated as a column vector
  print(result)  # Output: [1 2 3]
  ```
  Here, `v` is treated as a column vector to match the matrix dimensions for multiplication, even though its shape is `(3,)` and not `(3, 1)`.

- If you need an explicit row or column vector in NumPy, you must reshape the array to 2D with shapes like `(1, 3)` (row vector) or `(3, 1)` (column vector). For example:
  ```python
  row_vec = v.reshape(1, 3)  # Shape (1, 3) for row vector
  col_vec = v.reshape(3, 1)  # Shape (3, 1) for column vector
  print("Row vector shape:", row_vec.shape)
  print("Column vector shape:", col_vec.shape)
  ```

So, you didn’t miss anything in NumPy! The distinction between row and column vectors is not inherently enforced in 1D arrays; it often becomes relevant only when you explicitly reshape to 2D or when operations require specific dimensional compatibility.

#### PyTorch Tensors
PyTorch behaves very similarly to NumPy in this regard for 1D tensors. A 1D tensor with shape `(3,)` (e.g., `torch.tensor([1, 2, 3])`) is also a "flat" sequence and not inherently a row or column vector. Just like NumPy, PyTorch will often implicitly adjust the interpretation of a 1D tensor during operations like matrix multiplication to make shapes compatible. For example:

```python
import torch
v = torch.tensor([1, 2, 3], dtype=torch.float32)
M = torch.eye(3)  # 3x3 identity matrix
result = M @ v  # v is treated as a column vector
print(result)  # Output: tensor([1., 2., 3.])
```

However, PyTorch (like NumPy) allows you to explicitly define row or column vectors by reshaping a 1D tensor into a 2D tensor with shapes `(1, 3)` (row vector) or `(3, 1)` (column vector) using methods like `.unsqueeze()` or `.reshape()`:

```python
row_vec = v.unsqueeze(0)  # Shape (1, 3) for row vector
col_vec = v.unsqueeze(1)  # Shape (3, 1) for column vector
print("Row vector shape:", row_vec.shape)
print("Column vector shape:", col_vec.shape)
```

### Does PyTorch Make It Possible to Have Both Column and Row Vectors?

Yes, PyTorch does allow you to represent both column and row vectors, but only when you explicitly reshape a tensor into a 2D form. A 1D tensor in PyTorch (shape `(n,)`) is neither a row nor a column vector by default—it’s just a sequence of values, exactly like in NumPy. The distinction between row and column vectors arises only when you:

1. Reshape the tensor to have an explicit 2D shape, such as `(1, n)` for a row vector or `(n, 1)` for a column vector.
2. Encounter operations (like matrix multiplication with `@` or `torch.matmul`) where the distinction matters for dimensional compatibility. In these cases, PyTorch will often "broadcast" or interpret a 1D tensor as needed, just as NumPy does.

### Key Takeaway: Why the Distinction Was Highlighted in the Blog Post

In the second blog post (Part 1.2), I introduced the concept of reshaping a vector into a column vector with `.unsqueeze(1)` to illustrate how tensor shapes can be manipulated in PyTorch. This was intended to:

- Familiarize you with tensor dimension operations (`unsqueeze`, `squeeze`), which are critical in machine learning workflows (e.g., preparing data batches or aligning dimensions for neural network layers).
- Prepare you for future topics where explicit 2D shapes (like `(n, 1)` or `(1, n)`) are necessary, such as in matrix operations, broadcasting, or when feeding data into neural networks.

However, I should clarify that a 1D tensor in PyTorch does not inherently carry a row or column designation, just like in NumPy. The distinction becomes relevant only when you explicitly reshape or when operations demand a specific shape.

### Practical Implications for Reinforcement Learning

In reinforcement learning (and machine learning more broadly), whether a vector is a row or column often matters when:

- **Interfacing with neural networks:** Inputs to layers like `torch.nn.Linear` often expect specific shapes. For example, a batch of observations might need to be shaped as `(batch_size, feature_dim)`, which looks like a collection of row vectors.
- **Matrix operations:** When computing transformations or dot products, ensuring the correct shape (e.g., `(n, 1)` vs. `(1, n)`) avoids errors or unexpected broadcasting behavior.
- **Batching data:** RL algorithms often process multiple environments or time steps, requiring careful shape management.

### Summary

- **NumPy and PyTorch both** treat 1D arrays/tensors as flat sequences (shape `(n,)`), not inherently row or column vectors.
- Both libraries allow explicit row vectors (shape `(1, n)`) and column vectors (shape `(n, 1)`) by reshaping.
- You didn’t miss anything in NumPy; the row/column distinction is context-dependent and often implicit in 1D arrays.
- In PyTorch, as in NumPy, you can create explicit row or column vectors by reshaping, which is useful for specific operations or clarity in code.

# === USER ===

what's the difference between u.unsqueeze(0) and u.unsqueeze(1) in PyTorch?

# === ASSISTANT ===

I'm happy to clarify the difference between `unsqueeze(0)` and `unsqueeze(1)` in PyTorch. These methods are used to add a new dimension to a tensor at a specified position, which is particularly useful for reshaping tensors to match the expected input shapes for operations like batch processing or matrix multiplication. The difference lies in *where* the new dimension is added, which affects the tensor's shape and how it behaves in subsequent operations.

### What is `unsqueeze`?

In PyTorch, `unsqueeze(dim)` is a method that adds a singleton dimension (a dimension of size 1) at the specified index `dim` in the tensor's shape. This operation increases the number of dimensions of the tensor by 1, without changing the underlying data.

### `unsqueeze(0)` vs. `unsqueeze(1)`

Let’s break this down with a concrete example. Suppose you have a 1D tensor `u` with shape `(3,)`:

```python
import torch

u = torch.tensor([1, 2, 3], dtype=torch.float32)
print("Original u shape:", u.shape)  # Output: torch.Size([3])
```

#### Using `unsqueeze(0)`
- `u.unsqueeze(0)` adds a new dimension at index 0 (the first position in the shape tuple).
- This transforms the shape from `(3,)` to `(1, 3)`.
- Conceptually, this can be thought of as turning a 1D vector into a "row vector" in a 2D context, or adding a batch dimension at the front (common in machine learning for representing a single sample as a batch of size 1).

```python
u_row = u.unsqueeze(0)
print("Shape after unsqueeze(0):", u_row.shape)  # Output: torch.Size([1, 3])
print("u_row:", u_row)
# Output:
# tensor([[1., 2., 3.]])
```

Here, `u_row` has shape `(1, 3)`, meaning it has 1 row and 3 columns.

#### Using `unsqueeze(1)`
- `u.unsqueeze(1)` adds a new dimension at index 1 (the second position in the shape tuple).
- This transforms the shape from `(3,)` to `(3, 1)`.
- Conceptually, this can be thought of as turning a 1D vector into a "column vector" in a 2D context.

```python
u_col = u.unsqueeze(1)
print("Shape after unsqueeze(1):", u_col.shape)  # Output: torch.Size([3, 1])
print("u_col:", u_col)
# Output:
# tensor([[1.],
#         [2.],
#         [3.]])
```

Here, `u_col` has shape `(3, 1)`, meaning it has 3 rows and 1 column.

### Key Difference
- **`unsqueeze(0)`** adds a dimension at the *beginning* of the shape tuple, resulting in a shape like `(1, n, ...)`. For a 1D tensor, this typically resembles a row vector or a batch dimension.
- **`unsqueeze(1)`** adds a dimension at the *second position* of the shape tuple, resulting in a shape like `(n, 1, ...)` for a 1D tensor. For a 1D tensor, this typically resembles a column vector.

### Why Does This Matter?
The position of the new dimension affects how the tensor interacts with other tensors in operations like matrix multiplication, broadcasting, or when feeding data into neural networks. Here are a few practical implications:

1. **Matrix Multiplication:**
   - A tensor of shape `(1, 3)` (from `unsqueeze(0)`) behaves like a row vector in matrix operations.
   - A tensor of shape `(3, 1)` (from `unsqueeze(1)`) behaves like a column vector.
   - For example, if you multiply a matrix of shape `(3, 3)` by a tensor, the shapes must align:
     ```python
     M = torch.eye(3)  # 3x3 identity matrix
     result_col = M @ u_col  # Works: (3, 3) @ (3, 1) -> (3, 1)
     print("Matrix @ column vector:", result_col)
     # Output:
     # tensor([[1.],
     #         [2.],
     #         [3.]])
     
     # result_row = M @ u_row  # Fails: (3, 3) @ (1, 3) is incompatible
     ```

2. **Batching in Neural Networks:**
   - Neural networks in PyTorch often expect input data with a batch dimension as the first dimension (shape `(batch_size, ...)`). Using `unsqueeze(0)` on a single sample adds this batch dimension, making a single input compatible with batch processing.
     ```python
     single_sample = torch.tensor([1, 2, 3], dtype=torch.float32)  # Shape: (3,)
     batched_sample = single_sample.unsqueeze(0)  # Shape: (1, 3)
     print("Batched sample shape:", batched_sample.shape)
     ```

3. **Broadcasting:**
   - The position of the singleton dimension affects how PyTorch broadcasts the tensor during element-wise operations. For instance, a tensor of shape `(1, 3)` can be broadcast across rows, while `(3, 1)` can be broadcast across columns when paired with a larger tensor.

### General Rule for Higher Dimensions
The logic extends to tensors with more dimensions. For a tensor with shape `(a, b, c)`:
- `unsqueeze(0)` results in shape `(1, a, b, c)` (new dimension at the start).
- `unsqueeze(1)` results in shape `(a, 1, b, c)` (new dimension in the second position).
- You can also use negative indices, e.g., `unsqueeze(-1)` adds a dimension at the end.

### Reversing the Operation with `squeeze`
To remove a singleton dimension, you can use `squeeze(dim)` or just `squeeze()` (which removes all singleton dimensions). For example:
```python
u_row_squeezed = u_row.squeeze(0)  # Back to (3,)
u_col_squeezed = u_col.squeeze(1)  # Back to (3,)
print("u_row squeezed shape:", u_row_squeezed.shape)  # torch.Size([3])
print("u_col squeezed shape:", u_col_squeezed.shape)  # torch.Size([3])
```

### Summary
- **`unsqueeze(0)`**: Adds a dimension at index 0, often used to create a batch dimension or row-like shape (e.g., `(1, 3)` from `(3,)`).
- **`unsqueeze(1)`**: Adds a dimension at index 1, often used to create a column-like shape (e.g., `(3, 1)` from `(3,)`).
- The choice depends on the intended use case, such as preparing data for matrix operations, batching, or broadcasting.

If you have further questions about tensor shapes, operations, or specific use cases in reinforcement learning (e.g., how this applies to state vectors or neural network inputs), feel free to ask! Would you like to move on to the next blog post now?

# === USER ===

what does this syntax mean exactly? is this really a built-in feature of PyTorch?

```python
# Slice out every other element (e.g., elements at even indices).
u: torch.Tensor = v[::2]
print("u (every other element):", u)
print("u shape:", u.shape)  # Shape of the sliced tensor
```


# === ASSISTANT ===

I'm happy to explain the syntax `v[::2]` in the context of PyTorch and clarify whether this is a built-in feature. This syntax is indeed a standard and built-in feature of both PyTorch and Python in general, and it relates to **slicing**—a powerful mechanism for accessing subsets of data in sequences like lists, NumPy arrays, and PyTorch tensors.

### What Does `v[::2]` Mean?

The syntax `v[::2]` is a form of **slice notation** in Python, often referred to as the "extended slice" syntax. It is used to extract a subset of elements from a sequence (like a list or tensor) by specifying a start index, an end index, and a step size. The general form of slice notation is:

```
sequence[start:end:step]
```

- **`start`**: The index where the slice begins (inclusive). If omitted (as in `::2`), it defaults to the beginning of the sequence (index 0).
- **`end`**: The index where the slice ends (exclusive). If omitted (as in `::2`), it defaults to the end of the sequence.
- **`step`**: The increment between indices to include in the slice. If omitted, it defaults to 1. In `::2`, the step is 2, meaning "take every second element."

So, `v[::2]` means:
- Start from the beginning of `v` (implied `start=0`).
- Go until the end of `v` (implied `end=len(v)`).
- Take every second element (step=2), i.e., elements at indices 0, 2, 4, etc.

#### Example in PyTorch
Let’s see this in action with a PyTorch tensor:

```python
import torch

v = torch.tensor([10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60], dtype=torch.float32)
u = v[::2]
print("Original v:", v)
print("u (every other element):", u)
print("u shape:", u.shape)
```

**Output:**
```
Original v: tensor([10., 20., 30., 40., 50., 60.])
u (every other element): tensor([10., 30., 50.])
u shape: torch.Size([3])
```

Here, `u` contains elements from `v` at indices 0, 2, and 4 (i.e., 10, 30, 50), because the step size of 2 skips every other element.

### Is This a Built-In Feature of PyTorch?

Yes, this slicing syntax is a built-in feature of PyTorch, inherited from Python's core language features and extended to work with PyTorch tensors. Here's how it fits into the ecosystem:

1. **Python Origins**: Slice notation (`[start:end:step]`) is a fundamental feature of Python itself, originally designed for lists and strings. It allows flexible and readable access to subsequences.

2. **NumPy Influence**: Since PyTorch tensors are heavily inspired by NumPy arrays, they support the same slicing syntax as NumPy. In NumPy, slicing works on multi-dimensional arrays, and the `start:end:step` syntax applies to each dimension.

3. **PyTorch Implementation**: PyTorch tensors fully support Python’s slice notation, including the extended form with steps. When you use `v[::2]` on a PyTorch tensor, PyTorch internally handles the indexing operation and returns a new tensor (or a view of the original tensor, depending on the operation) with the requested elements. This works across all dimensions of a tensor, not just 1D.

#### Multi-Dimensional Slicing
For multi-dimensional tensors, you can apply slicing to each dimension separately. For example:

```python
# 2D tensor (matrix)
M = torch.tensor([[1, 2, 3, 4],
                  [5, 6, 7, 8],
                  [9, 10, 11, 12]])
sliced_M = M[::2, 1::2]  # Every other row, and every other column starting from index 1
print("Original M:\n", M)
print("Sliced M:\n", sliced_M)
```

**Output:**
```
Original M:
 tensor([[ 1,  2,  3,  4],
         [ 5,  6,  7,  8],
         [ 9, 10, 11, 12]])
Sliced M:
 tensor([[ 2,  4],
         [10, 12]])
```

Here, `::2` in the first dimension selects rows 0 and 2, and `1::2` in the second dimension selects columns 1 and 3 (starting at index 1, stepping by 2).

### Additional Notes on Slicing in PyTorch

- **Views vs. Copies**: Slicing a tensor in PyTorch often returns a "view" of the original tensor, meaning it shares the same underlying data (to save memory). However, operations that modify the sliced tensor might affect the original tensor if it’s a view, unless you explicitly create a copy with `.clone()` or `.detach()`.
  ```python
  v = torch.tensor([10, 20, 30, 40])
  u = v[::2]
  u[0] = 99  # Modifies the view, and thus the original tensor
  print("Modified v:", v)  # Output: tensor([99, 20, 30, 40])
  ```

- **Negative Steps**: You can use a negative step value to reverse the sequence. For example, `v[::-1]` reverses the tensor:
  ```python
  reversed_v = v[::-1]
  print("Reversed v:", reversed_v)  # Output: tensor([40, 30, 20, 99])
  ```

- **Performance**: Slicing in PyTorch is efficient and optimized, even for large tensors, as it often avoids copying data unless necessary.

### Why Use This Syntax in the Blog Post?

In the blog post (Part 1.2), I used `v[::2]` to demonstrate how to "slice out every other element" as a practical example of tensor manipulation. This is a common operation in data processing (e.g., downsampling data, selecting alternate time steps in RL trajectories, or debugging by inspecting subsets of data). The syntax is concise, readable, and widely used in Python, NumPy, and PyTorch communities.

### Summary

- `v[::2]` is standard Python slice notation meaning "take every second element from start to end."
- It is a built-in feature of PyTorch, inherited from Python and NumPy, and works on tensors of any dimension.
- It’s a powerful, efficient way to extract subsets of data, and it’s widely used in machine learning workflows.

## Introduction

Welcome back to Artintellica’s open-source Reinforcement Learning course with PyTorch! Having mastered creating, reshaping, and visualizing vectors and scalars in the previous post, we’re now ready to perform fundamental operations on them. Today, we’ll explore **vector addition**, **scalar multiplication**, and the **dot product**—operations that are at the heart of nearly every computation in machine learning and reinforcement learning (RL).

In this post, you will:

- Understand the mathematical definitions and intuitions behind these operations.
- See how PyTorch makes them intuitive and efficient with tensor operations.
- Apply these concepts through hands-on code demonstrations.
- Practice with exercises, including visualizing vector operations in 2D space.

These operations are building blocks for everything from updating agent parameters in RL to computing rewards or state transitions. Let’s dive in!

---

## Mathematics: Vector Operations

Let’s start with the mathematical foundations of the operations we’ll implement. We’ll use vectors in $\mathbb{R}^n$, meaning they have $n$ components.

### Vector Addition
Given two vectors $\mathbf{u} = [u_1, u_2, \ldots, u_n]$ and $\mathbf{v} = [v_1, v_2, \ldots, v_n]$ of the same dimension, their sum is defined element-wise:

$$
\mathbf{w} = \mathbf{u} + \mathbf{v} = [u_1 + v_1, u_2 + v_2, \ldots, u_n + v_n]
$$

Geometrically, this corresponds to placing the tail of $\mathbf{v}$ at the head of $\mathbf{u}$ and finding the resulting vector from the tail of $\mathbf{u}$ to the head of $\mathbf{v}$.

### Scalar Multiplication
Multiplying a vector $\mathbf{u}$ by a scalar $c \in \mathbb{R}$ scales each component:

$$
c \cdot \mathbf{u} = [c \cdot u_1, c \cdot u_2, \ldots, c \cdot u_n]
$$

Geometrically, this stretches (if $|c| > 1$), shrinks (if $|c| < 1$), or reverses (if $c < 0$) the vector while keeping its direction (or flipping it if negative).

### Dot Product
The dot product of two vectors $\mathbf{u}$ and $\mathbf{v}$ of the same dimension is a scalar value computed as:

$$
\mathbf{u} \cdot \mathbf{v} = u_1 \cdot v_1 + u_2 \cdot v_2 + \ldots + u_n \cdot v_n
$$

Geometrically, it measures how much one vector "goes in the direction" of another and is related to the angle $\theta$ between them via:

$$
\mathbf{u} \cdot \mathbf{v} = \|\mathbf{u}\| \cdot \|\mathbf{v}\| \cdot \cos(\theta)
$$

where $\|\mathbf{u}\|$ is the magnitude (Euclidean norm) of $\mathbf{u}$. In RL, dot products are often used in similarity measures or projections.

---

## Python Demonstrations

Let’s implement these operations using PyTorch tensors. We’ll work with small vectors for clarity, but these operations scale to any dimension.

### Demo 1: Vector Addition

```python
import torch

# Define two vectors
u: torch.Tensor = torch.tensor([1.0, 2.0, 3.0])
v: torch.Tensor = torch.tensor([4.0, 5.0, 6.0])

# Element-wise addition
w: torch.Tensor = u + v
print("u:", u)
print("v:", v)
print("u + v:", w)
```

**Expected Output:**
```
u: tensor([1., 2., 3.])
v: tensor([4., 5., 6.])
u + v: tensor([5., 7., 9.])
```

### Demo 2: Scalar Multiplication

```python
# Scalar multiplication
c: float = 2.0
scaled_u: torch.Tensor = c * u
print(f"u scaled by {c}:", scaled_u)
```

**Expected Output:**
```
u scaled by 2.0: tensor([2., 4., 6.])
```

PyTorch uses **broadcasting** to apply the scalar across all elements, so you don’t need to loop manually.

### Demo 3: Dot Product (Manual and Built-In)

```python
# Manual dot product using element-wise multiplication and sum
manual_dot: torch.Tensor = (u * v).sum()
print("Manual dot product (u · v):", manual_dot.item())

# Built-in dot product
builtin_dot: torch.Tensor = torch.dot(u, v)
print("Built-in dot product (u · v):", builtin_dot.item())
```

**Expected Output:**
```
Manual dot product (u · v): 32.0
Built-in dot product (u · v): 32.0
```

Both methods yield the same result: $1 \cdot 4 + 2 \cdot 5 + 3 \cdot 6 = 4 + 10 + 18 = 32$.

### Demo 4: Visualizing Vector Addition and Scalar Multiplication in 2D

Visualization helps build geometric intuition. We’ll use 2D vectors for simplicity.

```python
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# 2D vectors
u_2d: torch.Tensor = torch.tensor([1.0, 2.0])
v_2d: torch.Tensor = torch.tensor([2.0, 1.0])
sum_uv: torch.Tensor = u_2d + v_2d
scaled_u: torch.Tensor = 1.5 * u_2d

# Plotting
plt.figure(figsize=(6, 6))
plt.quiver(0, 0, u_2d[0], u_2d[1], angles='xy', scale_units='xy', scale=1, color='b', label='u')
plt.quiver(0, 0, v_2d[0], v_2d[1], angles='xy', scale_units='xy', scale=1, color='r', label='v')
plt.quiver(0, 0, sum_uv[0], sum_uv[1], angles='xy', scale_units='xy', scale=1, color='g', label='u + v')
plt.quiver(0, 0, scaled_u[0], scaled_u[1], angles='xy', scale_units='xy', scale=1, color='purple', label='1.5 * u')

plt.xlim(-1, 4)
plt.ylim(-1, 4)
plt.grid(True)
plt.axhline(0, color='black', linewidth=0.5)
plt.axvline(0, color='black', linewidth=0.5)
plt.title("Vector Addition and Scalar Multiplication in 2D")
plt.xlabel("x")
plt.ylabel("y")
plt.legend()
plt.show()
```

This plots vectors as arrows from the origin, showing how addition forms a parallelogram resultant and how scaling stretches a vector.

## Exercises

Let’s apply what you’ve learned with hands-on coding tasks. Use a new Python script or Jupyter notebook for these exercises.

### **Exercise 1: Implement Vector Addition Using PyTorch**

- Create two 1D vectors $\mathbf{a} = [2, 3, 4, 5]$ and $\mathbf{b} = [1, 1, 1, 1]$ as float tensors.
- Compute their sum $\mathbf{c} = \mathbf{a} + \mathbf{b}$ using PyTorch.
- Print all three vectors.

### **Exercise 2: Scale a Vector by a Scalar (Both Manual and Using Broadcasting)**

- Take vector $\mathbf{a}$ from Exercise 1 and scale it by $c = 3.0$.
- First, do this manually by multiplying each element (using a loop or element-wise operation).
- Then, use PyTorch’s broadcasting (direct multiplication).
- Print both results to confirm they match.

### **Exercise 3: Compute the Dot Product of Two Vectors (Manual and Built-In)**

- Using vectors $\mathbf{a}$ and $\mathbf{b}$ from Exercise 1, compute their dot product manually (element-wise multiply and sum).
- Compute the dot product using PyTorch’s built-in `torch.dot` function.
- Print both results to confirm they are identical.

### **Exercise 4: Visualize Vector Addition and Scalar Multiplication in 2D with Matplotlib**

- Create two 2D vectors $\mathbf{d} = [1, 3]$ and $\mathbf{e} = [2, 1]$.
- Compute their sum $\mathbf{f} = \mathbf{d} + \mathbf{e}$ and a scaled version of $\mathbf{d}$ by $c = 0.5$.
- Plot all four vectors ($\mathbf{d}$, $\mathbf{e}$, $\mathbf{f}$, and scaled $\mathbf{d}$) using `plt.quiver` as arrows from the origin, with different colors and a legend.

## Introduction

Welcome back to Artintellica’s open-source Reinforcement Learning course with PyTorch! After mastering vector operations like addition, scalar multiplication, and dot products, it’s time to step into the world of **matrices**—2D tensors that are fundamental to machine learning and reinforcement learning (RL). Matrices represent linear transformations, weight layers in neural networks, and transition models in RL environments, making them indispensable.

In this post, you will:

- Learn how to construct matrices as 2D tensors in PyTorch and understand their shapes.
- Explore basic matrix operations like transposition, element-wise addition, and multiplication.
- Understand broadcasting between matrices and vectors, a powerful feature of PyTorch.
- Practice these concepts with hands-on coding exercises.

Let’s build on our vector knowledge and dive into the 2D realm!

## Mathematics: Matrices and Basic Operations

A **matrix** is a rectangular array of numbers arranged in rows and columns, often denoted as $A \in \mathbb{R}^{m \times n}$, where $m$ is the number of rows and $n$ is the number of columns. For example, a $2 \times 3$ matrix looks like:

$$
A = \begin{bmatrix}
a_{11} & a_{12} & a_{13} \\
a_{21} & a_{22} & a_{23}
\end{bmatrix}
$$

In PyTorch, matrices are represented as 2D tensors with shape `(m, n)`.

### Key Concepts and Operations

1. **Shape**: The dimensions of a matrix, e.g., `(rows, columns)`. Shape determines compatibility for operations.
2. **Transpose**: The transpose of a matrix $A$, denoted $A^T$, swaps rows and columns, so $A^T_{ij} = A_{ji}$. For the above matrix, $A^T$ is a $3 \times 2$ matrix.
3. **Element-wise Addition**: For two matrices $A$ and $B$ of the same shape, $C = A + B$ means $c_{ij} = a_{ij} + b_{ij}$.
4. **Element-wise Multiplication**: Similarly, $C = A * B$ means $c_{ij} = a_{ij} \cdot b_{ij}$ (also called the Hadamard product).
5. **Broadcasting**: PyTorch can automatically expand smaller tensors to match the shape of larger ones during operations, enabling efficient computation without explicit looping.

These operations are foundational for neural network layers (where weights are matrices) and RL algorithms (where matrices might represent state transitions or policy mappings).

---

## Python Demonstrations

Let’s see how to work with matrices in PyTorch. We’ll construct matrices, inspect their shapes, and perform basic operations.

### Demo 1: Creating Matrices with Specific Shapes

```python
import torch

# Create a 2x3 matrix (2 rows, 3 columns)
A: torch.Tensor = torch.tensor([[1.0, 2.0, 3.0],
                               [4.0, 5.0, 6.0]])
print("Matrix A:\n", A)
print("Shape of A:", A.shape)

# Create a 3x2 matrix using arange and reshape
B: torch.Tensor = torch.arange(6, dtype=torch.float32).reshape(3, 2)
print("Matrix B:\n", B)
print("Shape of B:", B.shape)
```

**Expected Output:**
```
Matrix A:
 tensor([[1., 2., 3.],
         [4., 5., 6.]])
Shape of A: torch.Size([2, 3])
Matrix B:
 tensor([[0., 1.],
         [2., 3.],
         [4., 5.]])
Shape of B: torch.Size([3, 2])
```

### Demo 2: Transposing a Matrix

```python
# Transpose matrix A (2x3 -> 3x2)
A_transpose: torch.Tensor = A.T
print("Transpose of A (A^T):\n", A_transpose)
print("Shape of A^T:", A_transpose.shape)
```

**Expected Output:**
```
Transpose of A (A^T):
 tensor([[1., 4.],
         [2., 5.],
         [3., 6.]])
Shape of A^T: torch.Size([3, 2])
```

### Demo 3: Element-wise Addition and Multiplication

```python
# Create two 2x3 matrices for element-wise operations
C: torch.Tensor = torch.tensor([[0.5, 1.5, 2.5],
                               [3.5, 4.5, 5.5]])

# Element-wise addition
D_add: torch.Tensor = A + C
print("Element-wise addition (A + C):\n", D_add)

# Element-wise multiplication (Hadamard product)
D_mul: torch.Tensor = A * C
print("Element-wise multiplication (A * C):\n", D_mul)
```

**Expected Output:**
```
Element-wise addition (A + C):
 tensor([[1.5, 3.5, 5.5],
         [7.5, 9.5, 11.5]])
Element-wise multiplication (A * C):
 tensor([[0.5, 3.0, 7.5],
         [14.0, 22.5, 33.0]])
```

### Demo 4: Broadcasting with a Matrix and a Vector

Broadcasting allows PyTorch to align dimensions automatically. Let’s add a vector to each row of a matrix.

```python
# 1D vector to broadcast
vec: torch.Tensor = torch.tensor([10.0, 20.0, 30.0])
print("Vector to broadcast:", vec)
print("Shape of vec:", vec.shape)

# Broadcasting: Add vec to each row of A
result_broadcast: torch.Tensor = A + vec
print("A + broadcasted vec:\n", result_broadcast)
```

**Expected Output:**
```
Vector to broadcast: tensor([10., 20., 30.])
Shape of vec: torch.Size([3])
A + broadcasted vec:
 tensor([[11., 22., 33.],
         [14., 25., 36.]])
```

Here, `vec` (shape `(3,)`) is broadcasted to match the shape of `A` (shape `(2, 3)`), effectively adding it to each row.

---

## Exercises

- Compute their element-wise sum and product.
- Print the original matrices and the results.

### **Exercise 4: Demonstrate Broadcasting with a Matrix and a Vector**

## Introduction

Welcome back to Artintellica’s open-source RL journey with PyTorch! In the last post, we learned about matrices, their construction, and basic operations. Today, we’re focusing on a feature that makes PyTorch (and NumPy) extremely expressive and concise: **broadcasting**.

Broadcasting allows you to perform elementwise operations across tensors of different shapes without manual replication, making code shorter, less error-prone, and more efficient. It's a cornerstone for neural networks, RL policy parameters, quick dataset transformations, and more.

In this post, you’ll:

- Build a solid mathematical and mental model for broadcasting.
- Use it to add row/column vectors to matrices in just one line.
- Diagnose and fix common broadcasting shape errors.
- Compare manual element-wise code to PyTorch's broadcasting.

---

## Mathematics: Broadcasting and Elementwise Operations

**Elementwise Operations:**  
Given two tensors $A$ and $B$ of the same shape, an elementwise operation (e.g., addition or multiplication) produces a tensor $C$ where $c_{ij} = f(a_{ij}, b_{ij})$ for some binary function $f$ (like $+$ or $\times$).

**Broadcasting:**  
If shapes are compatible (more below), PyTorch "broadcasts" the smaller tensor across the larger one as needed, implicitly "expanding" its dimensions so elementwise operations are still possible without extra memory cost.

**Broadcasting rules:**  
For each dimension, starting from the end:
- If the dimensions are equal, or
- If one dimension is 1,  
then the operation can proceed by expanding the size-1 dimension as needed.

For example, $A$ of shape $(m, n)$ and $b$ of shape $(n,)$:
- $b$ is broadcast to shape $(m, n)$, so $A + b$ adds $b$ to every row of $A$.

---

## Python Demonstrations

### Demo 1: Add a Row Vector to Each Row of a Matrix (Broadcasting)

```python
import torch

A: torch.Tensor = torch.tensor([[1.0, 2.0, 3.0],
                                [4.0, 5.0, 6.0],
                                [7.0, 8.0, 9.0]])
row: torch.Tensor = torch.tensor([10.0, 20.0, 30.0])  # Shape: (3,)

# Broadcasting: Add row to each row of A
A_plus_row: torch.Tensor = A + row
print("Matrix A:\n", A)
print("Row vector:", row)
print("Result of A + row:\n", A_plus_row)
```

**Explanation:**  
Here, `row` is broadcast to each row of `A`, so each element of the row vector is added to the corresponding column of every row.

---

### Demo 2: Multiply a Matrix by a Column Vector (Broadcasting)

```python
col: torch.Tensor = torch.tensor([[2.0], [3.0], [4.0]])  # Shape: (3, 1)

# Broadcasting: Multiply each row of A by the corresponding element in col
A_times_col: torch.Tensor = A * col
print("Column vector:\n", col)
print("Result of A * col:\n", A_times_col)
```

**Explanation:**  
Here, the column vector (shape `(3,1)`) multiplies each row of `A` by a different scalar (2, 3, 4), thanks to broadcasting along the columns.

---

### Demo 3: Identify and Fix a Broadcasting Error

Some shapes cannot be broadcast due to mismatch. Let's see an example and fix it:

```python
try:
    bad_vec: torch.Tensor = torch.tensor([1.0, 2.0])
    # A has shape (3,3); bad_vec has shape (2,). Not broadcastable!
    res = A + bad_vec
except RuntimeError as e:
    print("Broadcasting error:", e)

# Fix: Use a vector of shape (3,) or reshape for broadcasting compatibility
good_vec: torch.Tensor = torch.tensor([1.0, 2.0, 3.0])
fixed_res: torch.Tensor = A + good_vec
print("Fixed result (A + good_vec):\n", fixed_res)
```

---

### Demo 4: Compare Manual Elementwise Operations with PyTorch's Broadcasting

You could implement element-wise addition using loops, but broadcasting is faster and more readable.

```python
# Manual using loops (for small examples)
manual_sum: torch.Tensor = torch.empty_like(A)
for i in range(A.shape[0]):
    for j in range(A.shape[1]):
        manual_sum[i, j] = A[i, j] + row[j]

print("Manual elementwise sum:\n", manual_sum)

# PyTorch broadcasting (just one line)
broadcast_sum: torch.Tensor = A + row
print("Broadcast sum:\n", broadcast_sum)

# Confirm equality
print("Are they equal?", torch.allclose(manual_sum, broadcast_sum))
```

---

## Exercises

Try these in a Python file or Jupyter notebook:

### **Exercise 1:** Add a Row Vector to Each Row of a Matrix Using Broadcasting

- Create a $3 \times 4$ matrix `M` (e.g., `torch.arange(12).reshape(3,4)`).
- Create a row vector `v` of length 4 (e.g., `[1.0, 10.0, 100.0, 1000.0]`).
- Use broadcasting to add `v` to each row of `M`. Print the result.

### **Exercise 2:** Multiply a Matrix by a Column Vector Using Broadcasting

- Create a $4 \times 2$ matrix `N` (e.g., with `torch.tensor` or `torch.arange`).
- Create a column vector of shape $(4,1)$ (e.g., [[2.], [4.], [6.], [8.]]).
- Use broadcasting to multiply `N` and the column vector. Print the result.

### **Exercise 3:** Identify and Fix a Broadcasting Error in Code

- Intentionally try to broadcast a $(5,3)$ matrix with a vector of shape $(2,)$.
- Observe and print the error message.
- Fix the shapes so that broadcasting works (e.g., use a vector of shape $(3,)$ or $(5,1)$).

### **Exercise 4:** Compare Manual Elementwise Operations with PyTorch’s Operators

- For a $2 \times 3$ matrix `P` and a row vector `w` of length 3,
    - Compute `P + w` using explicit loops and save to `P_manual`.
    - Compute `P + w` using broadcasting (`P + w`) and save as `P_broadcast`.
    - Print both results and confirm they are identical.

# PyTorch broadcast

## Mathematics: Matrix Multiplication and Transpose

### Matrix Multiplication

Given matrices $A$ of shape $(m, n)$ and $B$ of shape $(n, p)$, the product $C = AB$ is a new matrix of shape $(m, p)$:

$$
C_{ij} = \sum_{k=1}^{n} A_{ik} \cdot B_{kj}
$$

- Each entry $C_{ij}$ is the dot product of the $i$-th row of $A$ and the $j$-th column of $B$.
- **Dimensional rule:** The number of *columns* in $A$ must equal the number of *rows* in $B$.

### Matrix Transpose

The **transpose** of a matrix $A$, denoted as $A^T$, swaps row and column indices:

$$
(A^T)_{ij} = A_{ji}
$$

So, if $A$ is $m \times n$, then $A^T$ is $n \times m$.

Transposing is fundamental for aligning shapes in matrix operations.

## Python Demonstrations

Let's see how to do all this in PyTorch—cleanly, concisely, and reproducibly.

### Demo 1: Multiply Two Matrices Using `@` and `torch.matmul`

```python
import torch

# A: 2x3 matrix
A: torch.Tensor = torch.tensor([[1.0, 2.0, 3.0],
                               [4.0, 5.0, 6.0]])
# B: 3x2 matrix
B: torch.Tensor = torch.tensor([[7.0, 8.0],
                               [9.0, 10.0],
                               [11.0, 12.0]])

# Method 1: Using "@" operator
C1: torch.Tensor = A @ B
print("A @ B:\n", C1)

# Method 2: Using torch.matmul
C2: torch.Tensor = torch.matmul(A, B)
print("torch.matmul(A, B):\n", C2)
```

**Output:**
```
A @ B:
 tensor([[ 58.,  64.],
         [139., 154.]])
torch.matmul(A, B):
 tensor([[ 58.,  64.],
         [139., 154.]])
```

### Demo 2: Matrix Multiplication “By Hand” Using Loops

Let’s manually implement matrix multiplication and compare the results.

```python
def matmul_manual(A: torch.Tensor, B: torch.Tensor) -> torch.Tensor:
    m, n = A.shape
    n2, p = B.shape
    assert n == n2, "Matrix dimensions do not match!"
    C = torch.zeros((m, p), dtype=A.dtype)
    for i in range(m):
        for j in range(p):
            for k in range(n):
                C[i, j] += A[i, k] * B[k, j]
    return C

C3: torch.Tensor = matmul_manual(A, B)
print("Manual matmul(A, B):\n", C3)
print("Equal to PyTorch matmul?", torch.allclose(C1, C3))
```

### Demo 3: Visualize the Effect of Transposing a Matrix

Let’s see how the data and shape changes when transposing.

```python
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Visualize data of a matrix and its transpose
M: torch.Tensor = torch.tensor([[1, 2, 3],
                                [4, 5, 6]])

fig, axs = plt.subplots(1, 2, figsize=(8, 4))
axs[0].imshow(M, cmap='viridis', aspect='auto')
axs[0].set_title('Original M\nshape={}'.format(M.shape))
axs[0].set_xlabel('Columns')
axs[0].set_ylabel('Rows')
axs[1].imshow(M.T, cmap='viridis', aspect='auto')
axs[1].set_title('Transposed M\nshape={}'.format(M.T.shape))
axs[1].set_xlabel('Columns')
axs[1].set_ylabel('Rows')
plt.tight_layout()
plt.show()
```

### Demo 4: Shape-Mismatch Error and How to Fix

A common scenario: trying to multiply incompatible matrices. Let’s see how to catch and fix it.

```python
D: torch.Tensor = torch.tensor([[1.0, 2.0]])
E: torch.Tensor = torch.tensor([[3.0, 4.0]])
try:
    bad_result = D @ E
except RuntimeError as err:
    print("Shape mismatch error:", err)

# Fix: Transpose E
fixed_result = D @ E.T
print("Fixed result (D @ E.T):", fixed_result)
```

---

## Exercises

Practice and visualize these concepts with hands-on code!

### **Exercise 1:** Multiply Two Matrices Using `@` and `torch.matmul`

- Create matrix $M_1$ of shape $(2, 4)$ (e.g., fill with numbers from 1 to 8).
- Create matrix $M_2$ of shape $(4, 3)$ (e.g., fill with numbers 9 to 20).
- Multiply using both `@` and `torch.matmul`. Print both results—are they equal?

### **Exercise 2:** Implement Matrix Multiplication “By Hand” Using Loops and Compare

- Implement matrix multiplication manually using nested loops.
- Compare the manual result with PyTorch’s builtin `@`; confirm they are identical.

### **Exercise 3:** Visualize the Effect of Transposing a Matrix

- Create any $3 \times 5$ matrix with sequential values.
- Plot the matrix and its transpose side-by-side using `imshow` and print their shapes.

### **Exercise 4:** Explain and Fix a Common Shape-Mismatch Error in Matmul

- Intentionally attempt $X @ Y$ where $X$ is $3 \times 2$ and $Y$ is $3 \times 2$ (not allowed).
- Print the error.
- Fix the error by transposing $Y$ or $X$ and perform the multiplication successfully.

## Introduction

Welcome back to Artintellica’s RL with PyTorch! After conquering matrix multiplication and transpose, you’re ready for the next foundation: **geometry with tensors**. Modern machine learning is deeply geometric. Understanding vector length, distance, angle, and projections lets you reason about similarity, optimization, and even why RL agents make the decisions they do.

In this post, you’ll:

- Compute norms (lengths) and distances in high-dimensional space.
- Quantify similarity using cosine of angles between vectors.
- Project vectors onto each other and visualize the result.
- Practice and build intuition through hands-on, code-first exercises.

Let’s unlock the geometric heart of tensors!

## Mathematics: Geometry, Norms, and Projections

### Norm (Length) of a Vector

The **Euclidean norm** (or $L_2$ norm) of vector $\mathbf{v}$ is its length:

$$
\|\mathbf{v}\| = \sqrt{v_1^2 + v_2^2 + \dots + v_n^2}
$$

Also written as $\|\mathbf{v}\|_2$.

### Distance Between Two Vectors

The **Euclidean distance** between vectors $\mathbf{a}$ and $\mathbf{b}$ is:

$$
d(\mathbf{a}, \mathbf{b}) = \|\mathbf{a} - \mathbf{b}\| = \sqrt{\sum_{i=1}^n (a_i - b_i)^2}
$$

### Cosine Similarity (Angle Between Vectors)

The **cosine similarity** between vectors $\mathbf{a}$ and $\mathbf{b}$ is:

$$
\cos \theta = \frac{\mathbf{a} \cdot \mathbf{b}}{\|\mathbf{a}\| \, \|\mathbf{b}\|}
$$

- $\cos\theta = 1$ means vectors point the same way.
- $\cos\theta = 0$ means they are perpendicular.
- $\cos\theta = -1$ means they point in opposite directions.

Cosine similarity is a key measure in ML and RL for comparing states, actions, or gradients.

### Projection of One Vector onto Another

The **projection** of $\mathbf{a}$ onto $\mathbf{b}$ (think: the shadow of $\mathbf{a}$ on $\mathbf{b}$), denoted $\operatorname{proj}_{\mathbf{b}} \mathbf{a}$, is:

$$
\operatorname{proj}_{\mathbf{b}} \mathbf{a} = \frac{\mathbf{a} \cdot \mathbf{b}}{\|\mathbf{b}\|^2} \mathbf{b}
$$

This decomposes $\mathbf{a}$ into a component "along" $\mathbf{b}$ (the projection) and the remainder (orthogonal).

## Python Demonstrations

Let’s see each operation in PyTorch and visualize!

### Demo 1: Compute the Euclidean Norm (Length) of a Vector

```python
import torch

v: torch.Tensor = torch.tensor([3.0, 4.0])
norm_v: torch.Tensor = torch.norm(v, p=2)
print("Vector v:", v)
print("Euclidean norm (||v||):", norm_v.item())
```
**Output:**  
Should print $5.0$ since $\sqrt{3^2 + 4^2} = 5$.

---

### Demo 2: Find the Distance Between Two Vectors

```python
a: torch.Tensor = torch.tensor([1.0, 2.0, 3.0])
b: torch.Tensor = torch.tensor([4.0, 6.0, 8.0])
dist: torch.Tensor = torch.dist(a, b, p=2)
print("a:", a)
print("b:", b)
print("Euclidean distance between a and b:", dist.item())
# or equivalently...
alt_dist: torch.Tensor = torch.norm(a - b)
print("Alternative distance (torch.norm):", alt_dist.item())
```

---

### Demo 3: Calculate Cosine Similarity Between Two Vectors

```python
# Cosine similarity with a manual formula
a_norm: torch.Tensor = torch.norm(a)
b_norm: torch.Tensor = torch.norm(b)
cos_sim: torch.Tensor = torch.dot(a, b) / (a_norm * b_norm)
print("Cosine similarity between a and b:", cos_sim.item())

# Built-in version for batches
cos_sim_builtin: torch.Tensor = torch.nn.functional.cosine_similarity(a.unsqueeze(0), b.unsqueeze(0))
print("Cosine similarity (PyTorch builtin, batch):", cos_sim_builtin.item())
```

---

### Demo 4: Project One Vector onto Another and Plot Both

```python
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# 2D vectors for visualization
a2d: torch.Tensor = torch.tensor([3.0, 1.0])
b2d: torch.Tensor = torch.tensor([2.0, 0.0])
# Compute projection
proj_length: torch.Tensor = torch.dot(a2d, b2d) / torch.dot(b2d, b2d)
proj_vec: torch.Tensor = proj_length * b2d
print("a2d:", a2d)
print("b2d:", b2d)
print("Projection of a2d onto b2d:", proj_vec)

# Plot
plt.figure(figsize=(6, 6))
plt.quiver(0, 0, a2d[0], a2d[1], angles='xy', scale_units='xy', scale=1, color='b', label='a2d')
plt.quiver(0, 0, b2d[0], b2d[1], angles='xy', scale_units='xy', scale=1, color='r', label='b2d')
plt.quiver(0, 0, proj_vec[0], proj_vec[1], angles='xy', scale_units='xy', scale=1, color='g', label='proj_b(a)')
plt.legend()
plt.xlim(-1, 5)
plt.ylim(-1, 3)
plt.grid(True)
plt.axhline(0, color='black', linewidth=0.3)
plt.axvline(0, color='black', linewidth=0.3)
plt.title("Vector Projection in 2D")
plt.xlabel("x")
