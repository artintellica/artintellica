i need your help to produce a series of blog posts. we are learning machine learning, and we are doing it with pytorch. our focus is on reinforcement learning. the series is called "Learn Reinforcement Learning with PyTorch".

i need your help to write each blog post. there should always be an intro, an overview of mathematical concepts including definitions, a section connecting the math to the code, and then a series of python demos, and then a series of python exercises.

always include the code for the exercises. put the full code for the python exercises after the description of each exercise. no need to hide the code from the reader.

for all python code, always use fully typed code with type hints.

each blog post should always use dollar-denominated math equations. for instance, $V(s) = \mathbb{E}[G_t \mid s_t = s]$ for the state value function, where $G_t$ is the return starting from time $t$.

block-level math equations should be in double dollar signs, like this:

$$
V(s) = \mathbb{E}[G_t \mid s_t = s]
$$

where $G_t$ is the return starting from time $t$.

always put front-matter at the top o the blog post, including title, author, and date, like this:
