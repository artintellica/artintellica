i need your help with a project. i am learning machine learning, and i am doing it in a unique way. i am writing an open source blog called Artintellica. i have already gone through linear algebra, calculus, and deep learning. i am now moving onto reinforcement learning.

the way it works is that i am creating a series of blog posts for each subject. each blog post has math, python examples, and exercises in python. although some subjects are very mathematicaly, we never have purely math exercises. instead, we always have python code exercises.

the next thing i am doing is reinforcement learning. the basic idea for this course is to learn reinforcement learning with pytorch. we will be starting with elemtnary matrices and vectors, and then moving onto more advanced subjects including neural networks, reinforcement learning, and deep reinforcement learning.

i need your help to product the first blog post. each blog post should always start with front-matter, which looks like this:

+++
title = "Learning Reinforcement Learning with PyTorch, Part N.M: [the title of the blog post]"
author = "Artintellica"
date = "2025-06-09" [or whatever the date is]
+++

for each blog post, always give an explanation of the subject at hand. whenever necessary, use mathematics, including definitions and perhaps occassionally mathematical proofs. be sure to include introductory and concluding sections. the basic structure of each blog post should be something like this:

- introduction
- mathematics (if necessary)
- python demonstrations with full code
- python exercises for the reader to try
- conclusion

for all python code, always use python type hints wherever possible. and if you need to give installation instructions, use uv.

now i will proceed to give you the outline. can you please respond by writing the first blog post? please respond with the blog post only. oh, and be sure that for all math you do, you always do dollar-denominated math. use one dollar symbol for inline math, and two dollar symbols for display math.

the outline is as follows:

date = "2024-06-09"
+++

Welcome! This is the first entry in **Artintellica's Reinforcement Learning series**—a practical, code-driven open-source course where we build mathematical foundations and RL agents **from vectors to deep Q-networks, all with PyTorch**. Whether you've found us via GitHub, search, or your love of math and code, *thank you*. This blog is intended for ambitious beginners who want more than a "black box" approach.

What sets this course apart?

- **Code-first:** Every exercise uses Python, and everything is done in code—even math.
- **Open source:** Every post, example, and dataset is MIT licensed. Fork, modify, use!
- **Math-backed:** We'll use mathematics where appropriate—but always paired with concrete, hands-on coding.
- **PyTorch-powered:** PyTorch is now the dominant RL and deep learning research tool, with a gentle learning curve, intuitive tensor ops, and blazing performance on CPUs and GPUs.

**This first post** serves as both an orientation and your first hands-on steps: installing PyTorch, running "Hello Tensors", and manipulating your first data structures.

---

## What Will You Learn?

This post will help you:

- Understand how this RL course is structured (and what comes next)
- Install PyTorch on your system using the `uv` package manager
- Create and manipulate your first `torch.Tensor` objects
- Move tensors between CPU and GPU (if available)
- Run and interpret your first PyTorch computation

Each concept comes with code and hands-on exercises. By the end, you'll be ready for the math and code engine that powers everything in modern deep learning (and, soon, RL!).

---

## Why PyTorch? Why Not Just Numpy?

PyTorch is a numeric computation library like NumPy, but with several important differences that make it essential for modern ML and RL:

1. **Automatic Differentiation:** Critical for optimization and training models.
2. **Hardware Acceleration:** Fast computation on CPUs, GPUs (CUDA), and Apple Silicon (MPS) with almost no code changes.
3. **Dynamic Graphs:** Models can be defined and modified "on the fly", perfect for research and RL.
4. **Neural Network Utilities:** Everything from layers to RL-specific frameworks.
5. **Community & Ecosystem:** Used everywhere—if you can do it in deep RL, you can probably do it in PyTorch.

Throughout this course, you'll see how PyTorch lets us build RL agents—from table-based to neural-based—with minimal friction.

## Mathematics: How PyTorch Relates to Vectors and Matrices

At its core, PyTorch's **Tensor** object generalizes the matrix and vector concepts from linear algebra. In this blog, everything you learned about scalars ($a$), vectors ($\mathbf{x}$), and matrices ($A$) will correspond directly to PyTorch `Tensor` objects—uniquely enabling you to:

- Write code that *is* the math
- Run experiments interactively
- Train and debug agents at every complexity level

We'll often use math notation ($\mathbf{x}$, $A$, etc.) side-by-side with its exact code representation (`torch.Tensor`). As you encounter concepts like dot product, matrix multiplication, or vector norms, we'll show both the formula and its PyTorch incarnation.

---

## Installing PyTorch (with `uv`)

> ℹ️ For this blog, we'll assume you use Python 3.9 or later on Linux, macOS, or Windows. Use VS Code, Jupyter, or any Python IDE you like.

We recommend [uv](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv) for fast, reproducible, modern package management.

### **Step 1:** Install `uv` (if not already installed)

```sh
pip install --upgrade uv
```

### **Step 2:** Create a new project directory and initialize

```sh
mkdir rl-with-pytorch && cd rl-with-pytorch
uv venv
source .venv/bin/activate  # or .venv\Scripts\activate on Windows
```

### **Step 3:** Install PyTorch + matplotlib (for plots)

Find your install command at: [https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/](https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/).

For most CPU-only systems:

```sh
uv pip install torch torchvision torchaudio matplotlib
```

For CUDA-enabled GPUs, use the correct `torch` version:

```sh
uv pip install torch torchvision torchaudio --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu121
uv pip install matplotlib
```

### **Verify Installation**

Open Python:

```python
import torch
print("Torch version:", torch.__version__)
print(torch.rand(2, 2))
```

If this prints the version and a $2\times 2$ tensor of random numbers, you're ready!

---

## Python Demonstrations

Let's walk through key tensor operations.

### **Demo 1: Create a Tensor and Print Its Data, Shape, dtype**

```python
import torch

# Create a 1D tensor of floats, from 0 to 4
x: torch.Tensor = torch.arange(5, dtype=torch.float32)
print("x:", x)  # Tensor data
print("Shape:", x.shape)
print("Dtype:", x.dtype)
```

### **Demo 2: Move Tensor to GPU (if available) or MPS (Apple Silicon)**

```python
# Detect GPUs or MPS device (Apple Silicon)
if torch.cuda.is_available():
    device: torch.device = torch.device("cuda")
elif getattr(torch, "has_mps", False) and torch.backends.mps.is_available():
    device = torch.device("mps")
else:
    device = torch.device("cpu")
print(f"Using device: {device}")

x_gpu: torch.Tensor = x.to(device)
print("x is on device:", x_gpu.device)
```

### **Demo 3: "Hello World"—Elementwise Addition**

Elementwise addition is just like with math or NumPy: $z_i = x_i + y_i$

```python
y: torch.Tensor = torch.ones(5, dtype=torch.float32, device=device)
z: torch.Tensor = x_gpu + y  # elementwise add
print("z:", z)
```

## Exercises

Try these yourself! (Start from a new Python file, or use a Jupyter notebook.)

### **Exercise 1:** Install PyTorch and Verify

- Install using `uv` as above. Write Python code to import `torch` and print its version.

### **Exercise 2:** Create Your First Tensor

- Create a tensor of shape `(4, 3)` (4 rows, 3 cols) filled with random numbers.
- Print the tensor, its `shape`, and `dtype`.

### **Exercise 3:** Move Tensor Between Devices

- Detect if a GPU or MPS device is available.
- Move a tensor to CPU, then to device, and print its `.device` at each stage.

### **Exercise 4:** Hello World Addition

- Create two tensors of size `(6,)` (one with all zeros, one with all ones).
- Add them and print the result.

---

**Sample Starter Code for Exercises:**

```python
import torch

# EXERCISE 1
print("PyTorch version:", torch.__version__)

# EXERCISE 2
a: torch.Tensor = torch.randn(4, 3)
print("Tensor a:", a)
print("Shape:", a.shape)
print("Dtype:", a.dtype)

# EXERCISE 3
device: torch.device = torch.device("cuda" if torch.cuda.is_available() else "cpu")
b: torch.Tensor = torch.arange(6)
print("Before:", b.device)
b = b.to(device)
print("After:", b.device)

# EXERCISE 4
zero: torch.Tensor = torch.zeros(6)
one: torch.Tensor = torch.ones(6)
sum_: torch.Tensor = zero + one
print("Sum:", sum_)
```
