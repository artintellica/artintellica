## Introduction

Neural networks are much more than stacks of linear layers. **Activation functions** are the secret to their flexibility—they introduce nonlinearity, enabling your model to represent complex patterns, boundaries, and behaviors that no line can fit.

In this post, you’ll:

- Define and plot the key activation functions in modern ML.
- Train small neural nets with each activation and compare convergence.
- Visualize how activations affect gradient flow, leading to vanishing or exploding gradients.
- See what happens if you swap activations mid-training.

With this, you’ll understand why “the right activation” can make or break your deep RL agent!

---

## Mathematics: Activation Functions and Their Gradients

**Activation functions** “squash” or transform each neuron’s output before passing it to the next layer. Let $z \in \mathbb{R}$ be a neuron’s pre-activation input.

- **Sigmoid:** $$
  \sigma(z) = \frac{1}{1 + e^{-z}}
  $$
  Derivative: $\sigma'(z) = \sigma(z) (1 - \sigma(z))$

- **Tanh:** $$
  \tanh(z) = \frac{e^{z} - e^{-z}}{e^{z} + e^{-z}}
  $$
  Derivative: $1 - \tanh^2(z)$

- **ReLU:** $$
  \mathrm{ReLU}(z) = \max(0, z)
  $$
  Derivative: $1$ if $z > 0$, $0$ otherwise

- **LeakyReLU:** $$
  \mathrm{LeakyReLU}(z) = \begin{cases} z & \text{if } z \geq 0 \\ \alpha z & \text{if } z < 0 \end{cases}
  $$
  Typical $\alpha = 0.01$.

**The effects:**  
- Sigmoid and tanh “saturate” for large $|z|$—their gradients approach zero. This causes **vanishing gradients** in deep nets.
- ReLU avoids this for positive $z$, but can cause “dead neurons” if too many stay negative.
- LeakyReLU tries to fix dead neurons by using a small slope for $z < 0$.

---

## Explanation: How the Math Connects to Code

In code, the activation function is just a function applied elementwise to each neuron’s output—at each layer.

- In PyTorch, you get access to built-in functions (`torch.sigmoid`, `torch.tanh`, `F.relu`, `F.leaky_relu`) and modules (e.g., `nn.ReLU()`).
- Changing the activation changes **how quickly the network converges, what patterns it learns**, and whether gradients can flow during backpropagation.
- Problems like **vanishing gradients** (when gradients become too small to update parameters in deep nets) or **exploding gradients** can be traced back to the choice and sequence of activations.

In the demos and exercises, you’ll:
- See (and plot!) what each activation does to its inputs.
- Train small networks with only the activation changed—watching as some converge easily and others get stuck.
- Monitor gradients to observe saturation (“flatlining”) or healthy learning.
- Try swapping activations mid-training to observe their effect in real time.

        self.fc1: nn.Linear = nn.Linear(2, 8)
        self.fc2: nn.Linear = nn.Linear(8, 2)
        self.activation: str = activation
    def forward(self, x: torch.Tensor) -> torch.Tensor:
        if self.activation == "sigmoid":
            h: torch.Tensor = torch.sigmoid(self.fc1(x))
        elif self.activation == "tanh":
            h = torch.tanh(self.fc1(x))

acts: list[str] = ["sigmoid", "tanh", "relu", "leakyrelu"]
loss_hist: dict[str, list[float]] = {}
for act in acts:
    net: TinyNet = TinyNet(act)
    opt: torch.optim.Optimizer = torch.optim.Adam(net.parameters(), lr=0.08)

### Demo 3: Observe Vanishing/Exploding Gradients by Visualizing Gradients

```python
nets: dict[str, TinyNet] = {act: TinyNet(act) for act in acts}
grads_by_act: dict[str, list[float]] = {act: [] for act in acts}
for act, net in nets.items():
    opt = torch.optim.Adam(net.parameters(), lr=0.07)
    for epoch in range(60):
        logits = net(X)
        loss = nn.functional.cross_entropy(logits, y)
        opt.zero_grad()
        loss.backward()
        # Sum the absolute value of all gradients in first layer
        grad_norm = net.fc1.weight.grad.abs().mean().item()
        grads_by_act[act].append(grad_norm)
        opt.step()
for act in acts:
    plt.plot(grads_by_act[act], label=act)
plt.legend()
plt.xlabel("Epoch"); plt.ylabel("Mean Grad |fc1|")
plt.title("Mean First-Layer Gradient Magnitude by Activation")

for epoch in range(60):
    logits = net(X)
    loss = nn.functional.cross_entropy(logits, y)
    opt.zero_grad()
    loss.backward()
    opt.step()
    losses_swap.append(loss.item())
    if epoch == 35:
        net.activation = "relu"  # swap in-place!

### **Exercise 3:** Observe Vanishing/Exploding Gradients by Visualizing Gradients

- For each trained model in Exercise 2, collect the mean absolute gradient of the first linear layer’s weights after each epoch.
- Plot all gradients’ traces.

```python
grads_by_act = {act: [] for act in acts}
for act in acts:
    net = SmallNet(act)
    opt = torch.optim.Adam(net.parameters(), lr=0.1)
    for epoch in range(40):
        logits = net(X)
        loss = nn.functional.cross_entropy(logits, y)
        opt.zero_grad()
        loss.backward()
        grad_norm = net.fc1.weight.grad.abs().mean().item()
        grads_by_act[act].append(grad_norm)
        opt.step()
for act in acts:
    plt.plot(grads_by_act[act], label=act)
plt.xlabel("Epoch"); plt.ylabel("Mean |grad|")
plt.title("Gradient Magnitude by Activation Function")
plt.legend(); plt.grid(True); plt.show()
```

### **Exercise 4:** Swap Activation Mid-Training and Observe Changes

- Train using Tanh for the first 30 epochs, then switch to ReLU and continue.
- Plot the loss curve and mark the swap epoch.

```python
net: SmallNet = SmallNet("tanh")
opt: torch.optim.Optimizer = torch.optim.Adam(net.parameters(), lr=0.11)
losses_swap: list[float] = []
for epoch in range(60):
    logits = net(X)
    loss = nn.functional.cross_entropy(logits, y)
    opt.zero_grad()
    loss.backward()
    opt.step()
    losses_swap.append(loss.item())
    if epoch == 30:
        net.activation = "relu"  # swap activation at epoch 31
plt.plot(losses_swap)
plt.axvline(30, linestyle='--', color='k', label='Swapped to ReLU')
plt.xlabel("Epoch"); plt.ylabel("Loss")
plt.title("Changing Activation Function Mid-Training")
plt.legend(); plt.grid(True); plt.show()
```

## Conclusion

You’ve now:

- Graphed, compared, and internalized the impact of different activations.
- Watched their impact on network convergence and gradient flow.
- Learned about phenomena like vanishing/exploding gradients and “dead neurons.”
- Seen that activation functions can be hot-swapped—even mid-training!

**Up next:** You’ll dig deeper into what makes neural nets really “train”—backpropagation. You’ll demystify how gradients flow, get calculated, and sometimes stall in deep learning.

*Practice swapping, plotting, and analyzing on your own data! Understanding activations will supercharge your RL and deep net intuition. See you in Part 3.5!*

# === USER ===

your math was formatted a big wonky in one section. i fixed it. does this look right to you?

```markdown
## Mathematics: Activation Functions and Their Gradients

**Activation functions** “squash” or transform each neuron’s output before
passing it to the next layer. Let $z \in \mathbb{R}$ be a neuron’s
pre-activation input.

- **Sigmoid:** $ \sigma(z) = \frac{1}{1 + e^{-z}} $

  Derivative: $\sigma'(z) = \sigma(z) (1 - \sigma(z))$

- **Tanh:** $ \tanh(z) = \frac{e^{z} - e^{-z}}{e^{z} + e^{-z}} $

  Derivative: $1 - \tanh^2(z)$

- **ReLU:** $ \mathrm{ReLU}(z) = \max(0, z)$

  Derivative: $1$ if $z > 0$, $0$ otherwise

- **LeakyReLU:** $ \mathrm{LeakyReLU}(z) = \begin{cases} z & \text{if } z \geq 0
  \\ \alpha z & \text{if } z < 0 \end{cases}$

  Typical $\alpha = 0.01$.

**The effects:**

- Sigmoid and tanh “saturate” for large $|z|$—their gradients approach zero.
  This causes **vanishing gradients** in deep nets.
- ReLU avoids this for positive $z$, but can cause “dead neurons” if too many
  stay negative.
- LeakyReLU tries to fix dead neurons by using a small slope for $z < 0$.
```

...please give a brief response, assuming it is correct.

# === ASSISTANT ===

Yes, your formatting is correct and much clearer! Each activation and its derivative is distinct and well-separated, and the effects are nicely summarized in bullet points. This markdown will render cleanly and is easy to read. Well done!

## Introduction

Backpropagation ("backprop") is the heart of modern neural network training. It enables us to efficiently compute gradients for all parameters, making deep learning—and deep RL—practically feasible. In this post you'll:

- Intuitively understand what backpropagation does.
- Compute gradients for a small, two-layer neural net **by hand**.
- Use `.backward()` in PyTorch to automate and verify gradient calculations.
- Visualize how gradients flow through a network (and where/why they might vanish!).
- Debug a network suffering from vanishing gradients.

Grasping backprop is the difference between "using" neural nets and truly understanding them!

---

## Mathematics: Backpropagation in a Two-Layer Neural Network

Consider a **two-layer** neural net (no bias for simplicity) for one sample $x \in \mathbb{R}^2$:

$$
z_1 = W_1 x \\
h = \phi(z_1) \\
z_2 = W_2 h \\
y_{\mathrm{pred}} = \sigma(z_2)
$$

For a single output and target $y \in \{0,1\}$, use binary cross-entropy:

$$
L = -\left[y \log y_{\mathrm{pred}} + (1-y)\log(1-y_{\mathrm{pred}})\right]
$$

To optimize, we must compute **gradients**:
- $\frac{\partial L}{\partial W_2}$ (output weights)
- $\frac{\partial L}{\partial W_1}$ (input/hidden weights)

**Via chain rule**:

- $\frac{\partial L}{\partial W_2} = \frac{\partial L}{\partial y_{\mathrm{pred}}} \cdot \frac{\partial y_{\mathrm{pred}}}{\partial z_2} \cdot \frac{\partial z_2}{\partial W_2}$
- $\frac{\partial L}{\partial W_1} = \frac{\partial L}{\partial y_{\mathrm{pred}}} \cdot \frac{\partial y_{\mathrm{pred}}}{\partial z_2} \cdot \frac{\partial z_2}{\partial h} \cdot \frac{\partial h}{\partial z_1} \cdot \frac{\partial z_1}{\partial W_1}$

Each node ("layer output") passes gradients backward to previous layers—hence the name **backpropagation**.

---

## Explanation: How the Math Connects to Code

In code, backprop means:

- **Forward pass:** Pass an input through the network, get output and loss.
- **Backward pass:** Start at loss, PyTorch computes gradients for all tensors *with respect to* loss, using the computation graph and chain rule.
- For manual "by hand" computation, you calculate derivatives step-by-step for all layers and parameters.
- Comparing manual gradients and `.backward()` results gives confidence in your math and understanding.
- If any layer outputs or activations squash the gradients (e.g. sigmoid/tanh at large $|z|$), the gradient can become "vanishingly" small—this is the vanishing gradient problem.
- We can visualize "gradient flow" by plotting the mean/abs gradients at each layer parameter.

---

## Python Demonstrations

### Demo 1: Compute Gradients for a Two-Layer Network by Hand (Single Example)

Let's use simple numbers for hand calculation:  
Let $x = [1, 2]$, $W_1$ shape $(2, 2)$, $W_2$ shape $(1, 2)$, target $y=1$.

```python
import torch
import torch.nn.functional as F

# Input and target
x: torch.Tensor = torch.tensor([[1.0, 2.0]])      # (1, 2)
y: torch.Tensor = torch.tensor([1.0])             # (1,)

# Parameters (fixed small values for hand calc)
W1: torch.Tensor = torch.tensor([[0.1, -0.2],
                                 [0.3, 0.4]], requires_grad=True)  # (2,2)
W2: torch.Tensor = torch.tensor([[0.7, -0.5]], requires_grad=True) # (1,2)

# Forward pass (ReLU activation)
z1: torch.Tensor = x @ W1                         # (1,2)
h: torch.Tensor = F.relu(z1)                      # (1,2)
z2: torch.Tensor = h @ W2.T                       # (1,1)
y_pred: torch.Tensor = torch.sigmoid(z2).squeeze()# scalar

# Binary cross-entropy loss
eps: float = 1e-7
loss: torch.Tensor = - (y * torch.log(y_pred + eps) + (1 - y) * torch.log(1 - y_pred + eps))
print("Forward values:")
print("z1 =", z1.tolist())
print("h  =", h.tolist())
print("z2 =", z2.item())
print("y_pred =", y_pred.item())
print("loss =", loss.item())

# Manually compute:
# 1. dL/dy_pred = -1/y_pred
dL_dypred: float = float(-1.0 / y_pred.item())

# 2. dy_pred/dz2 = sigmoid'(z2)
dypred_dz2: float = float(y_pred.item() * (1 - y_pred.item()))

print("Manual dL/dy_pred:", dL_dypred)
print("Manual dy_pred/dz2:", dypred_dz2)
```
Now you can hand-multiply through the chain!

---

### Demo 2: Use `.backward()` to Compare with Manual Gradients

```python
# Backpropagation (PyTorch autograd)
# Zero gradients first
if W1.grad is not None: W1.grad.zero_()
if W2.grad is not None: W2.grad.zero_()
loss.backward()
print("PyTorch dL/dW2:\n", W2.grad)
print("PyTorch dL/dW1:\n", W1.grad)
```

You can now compare these with your manual chain calculation above!

---

### Demo 3: Visualize Gradient Flow in the Network

Let's use a bigger network and plot mean gradients at each parameter.

```python
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import torch.nn as nn

class TinyMLP(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, hidden: int = 6) -> None:
        super().__init__()
        self.fc1: nn.Linear = nn.Linear(2, hidden)
        self.fc2: nn.Linear = nn.Linear(hidden, 2)
    def forward(self, x: torch.Tensor) -> torch.Tensor:
        return self.fc2(F.relu(self.fc1(x)))

torch.manual_seed(11)
N: int = 200
X: torch.Tensor = torch.randn(N, 2)
y: torch.Tensor = (X[:,0] + X[:,1] > 0).long()
mlp: TinyMLP = TinyMLP(10)
opt: torch.optim.Optimizer = torch.optim.Adam(mlp.parameters(), lr=0.1)
grad1: list[float] = []
grad2: list[float] = []
for epoch in range(60):
    logits = mlp(X)
    loss = F.cross_entropy(logits, y)
    opt.zero_grad()
    loss.backward()
    grad1.append(mlp.fc1.weight.grad.abs().mean().item())
    grad2.append(mlp.fc2.weight.grad.abs().mean().item())
    opt.step()
plt.plot(grad1, label="fc1")
plt.plot(grad2, label="fc2")
plt.xlabel("Epoch"); plt.ylabel("Mean Abs Grad")
plt.title("Gradient Flow in MLP")
plt.legend(); plt.grid(True); plt.show()
```

    grad_hist.append(mean_grad)
    opt.step()
plt.plot(grad_hist)
plt.title("Vanishing Gradient in Deep Sigmoid Network")
plt.xlabel("Epoch"); plt.ylabel("Mean Gradient (all hidden layers)")
plt.grid(True); plt.show()

    def __init__(self, hidden: int = 32, depth: int = 6) -> None:
        super().__init__()
        self.layers: nn.ModuleList = nn.ModuleList([nn.Linear(2 if i==0 else hidden, hidden) for i in range(depth)])
        self.out: nn.Linear = nn.Linear(hidden, 2)
    def forward(self, x: torch.Tensor) -> torch.Tensor:
        for l in self.layers:
            x = F.relu(l(x))
        return self.out(x)

deep_mlp_relu: DeepMLPrelu = DeepMLPrelu()
opt2: torch.optim.Optimizer = torch.optim.Adam(deep_mlp_relu.parameters(), lr=0.07)
grad_hist_relu: list[float] = []
for epoch in range(30):
    logits = deep_mlp_relu(X)
    loss = F.cross_entropy(logits, y)
    opt2.zero_grad()
    loss.backward()
    mean_grad = torch.stack([l.weight.grad.abs().mean() for l in deep_mlp_relu.layers]).mean().item()
    grad_hist_relu.append(mean_grad)

plt.plot(grad_hist, label='Sigmoid')
plt.plot(grad_hist_relu, label='ReLU')
plt.xlabel("Epoch"); plt.ylabel("Mean Gradient")
plt.title("Vanishing Gradients: Sigmoid vs ReLU")
plt.legend(); plt.grid(True); plt.show()
```

## Conclusion

Now you:

- Understand what "backpropagation" means, both mathematically and in code.
- Have computed and checked gradients by hand and with autograd.
- Can visualize gradient flow and diagnose vanishing gradients.
- Know how activation choice and network depth can create or fix these issues.

**Next:** We’ll discuss overfitting, underfitting, and regularization—essentials for making your models robust on real-world (not just training) data.

*Stick with these basics: understanding gradients and backprop is the foundation of all deep learning and RL! See you in Part 3.6!*

# === USER ===

for your first two demos, i am now getting the same output. for one, the manul outputs are just numbers. and the pytorch backprop calculation is resulting in tensors. is this to be expected? that they are different? or is there a problem? here is the output


  ```
  Manual dL/dy_pred: -1.8269591317215457
Manual dy_pred/dz2: 0.24775725594076548
PyTorch dL/dW2:
 tensor([[-0.3168, -0.2716]])
PyTorch dL/dW1:
 tensor([[-0.3168,  0.2263],
        [-0.6337,  0.4526]])
        ```

# === ASSISTANT ===

Great question—and this is a classic point of confusion when you're working with hand-calculated gradients vs. PyTorch's `.backward()` results.

Let's break down what you are seeing, and what's expected.

---

## Why Are the Manual Outputs and PyTorch's Outputs "Different"?

### 1. **Manual Calculation ("upstream" or "partial" gradients)**
- When you print `Manual dL/dy_pred` and `Manual dy_pred/dz2`, you are computing **intermediate derivatives** (i.e., partial derivatives, not yet with respect to parameters).
- **Example:**  
    - `dL/dy_pred`: The derivative of the loss with respect to the final output probability (scalar).
    - `dy_pred/dz2`: The derivative of the sigmoid w.r.t. its input (also a scalar).
- You are **part-way along the chain rule**, not all the way to parameter gradients yet.

### 2. **PyTorch's `.backward()` Calculation**
- When you look at `W2.grad` and `W1.grad`, you are seeing the **full derivative of the loss with respect to the parameters** $W_1$ and $W_2$.
- These are tensors—same shape as the weights themselves.  
    - $W_2$ is shape $(1,2)$;  
    - $W_1$ is shape $(2,2)$;
- These are the **gradients you actually use for gradient descent!**

### 3. **Why Aren't They "Equal"?**
- You are not directly comparing the same quantities.
- Your manual values are *components* in the chain rule for $dL/dW$ or $dL/dW_2$—not the final answer for $dL/dW_2$. PyTorch's `.backward()` result is the **final answer**.
- If you want to check PyTorch’s values against hand-calculated values, you must apply **all the steps of the chain rule** and compute the full derivative w.r.t. the parameters (not just with respect to intermediate values).

---

**In summary:**
- **Manual dL/dy_pred** and **dL/dz2**: intermediate, scalar values along the chain rule.
- **PyTorch’s `W2.grad`, `W1.grad`**: full tensor derivatives w.r.t. the weights, after applying the full chain rule.

---

## How to Get Matching Results

If you want to match PyTorch’s `.backward()` results, finish the hand-calculation all the way to, say, $dL/dW_2$:

For a simple example, with $L$, sigmoid output, and $h$ (hidden activation):

- $dL/dW_2 = dL/dy_{pred} \cdot dy_{pred}/dz_2 \cdot dz_2/dW_2$
- Where $dz_2/dW_2 = h$ (hidden activations).

So,

$$
\frac{\partial L}{\partial W_2} = (dL/dy_{pred}) \cdot (dy_{pred}/dz_2) \cdot h
$$

Then, for your specific numbers, you can hand compute and check:  
- Compute $dL/dy_{pred}$
- Compute $dy_{pred}/dz_2$
- Compute the product above for each $W_2$ component, given $h$.

You should get the *same* numbers as PyTorch, up to numerical precision.

---

### Example for Your Case

- $dL/dy_{pred}$: (your output)
- $dy_{pred}/dz_2$: (your output)
- $h$: use the numerical values you got for $h$ above.

For each $i$,
$$
\frac{\partial L}{\partial W_{2,i}} = (dL/dy_{pred}) \cdot (dy_{pred}/dz_2) \cdot h_i
$$

Similarly, you can do the full chain-rule expansion for $dL/dW_1$.

---

## TL;DR

- **Manual calculations** are *intermediate* (not full parameter gradients yet).
- **PyTorch's gradients** are the *full derivatives* with respect to each parameter.
- To make them match, carry the manual calculation **all the way to the parameter gradient**, applying each step of the chain rule.

---

If you want, paste your *manual math result for $dL/dW_2$*, and let’s check it against PyTorch’s output! Let me know if you want help writing out the full hand-calculation for this example.

i'm getting an error with this code:

```python
l.weight.grad.abs()
```

it says object of type Tensor is not callable. how can i fix this?

# === ASSISTANT ===

You're getting this error because of a **common PyTorch "pitfall"**: you're using `.abs()` as if it were a method (i.e., `l.weight.grad.abs()`), but in PyTorch, `.abs` is a method **without parentheses** in NumPy **but with parentheses** in PyTorch, because in PyTorch, `.abs` is a method, not a property.

**But the actual issue is likely:** you may have accidentally written `.abs` instead of `.abs()` (you **must** include `()`!).

---

## Solution

Change this:

```python
l.weight.grad.abs
```

or

```python
l.weight.grad.abs   # Missing parentheses!
```

**To this:**

```python
l.weight.grad.abs()
```

---

## But What If You're Already Using `.abs()`?

If your existing code already reads `.abs()`, and you're *still* getting this error:

> "object of type 'Tensor' is not callable"

...then somewhere, you may have **overwritten the abs method** by assigning something else to `.abs`, or you have something like this (unusual):

```python
l.weight.grad.abs = something  # This is BAD: don't do this.
```

Or, in rare cases (incorrect use):

```python
l.weight.grad.abs = torch.abs
l.weight.grad.abs()  # Now this line fails
```

So **make sure you never assign to `.abs`**.

---

## Final Correct Line for Collecting Gradients

To get the mean absolute gradient from a weight matrix:

```python
grad_mean: float = l.weight.grad.abs().mean().item()
```

- `.abs()` **is a method** in PyTorch, so always include the parentheses.
- `.mean()` for the mean, then `.item()` to turn it into a Python float (if desired).

---

## Example (Correct):

```python
for l in layers:
    grad_value: float = l.weight.grad.abs().mean().item()
    grad_list.append(grad_value)
```

---

## TL;DR

- In PyTorch: Always use `.abs()` (with parentheses).
- If you get "Tensor is not callable", check for missing parentheses, or accidental overwriting of the attribute name `.abs`.

---

# === ASSISTANT ===

Great question! Let’s clarify.

In your code, **`l`** is each layer in `self.layers`, which is a `torch.nn.ModuleList` of `nn.Linear` layers.

Let's break it down:

```python
self.layers: nn.ModuleList = nn.ModuleList([nn.Linear(2 if i==0 else hidden, hidden) for i in range(depth)])
```
- Here, `self.layers` is a `ModuleList` containing several `nn.Linear` layers.

```python
for l in self.layers:
    x = torch.sigmoid(l(x))
```
- In the forward pass, `l` is *each layer* as it loops.

So, **`l` is an `nn.Linear` object**.

After backpropagation (`loss.backward()`), **`l.weight.grad`** is the gradient of layer `l`’s weights.

Thus, this line:
```python
mean_grad = torch.stack([l.weight.grad.abs().mean() for l in deep_mlp.layers]).mean().item()
```
- **Loops over every layer** in `deep_mlp.layers`,
- **Accesses the gradients** (`l.weight.grad`), takes the absolute value `.abs()`, gets the mean `.mean()`,
- **Stacks all means**, then averages them to get an overall mean gradient across all layers.

---

**In summary:**
- `l` is each `nn.Linear` layer in your list of hidden layers.
- `l.weight.grad.abs().mean()` gives the mean absolute gradient for the weights in a given layer.
- The code monitors (and averages) how strong gradients are, layer by layer, across the "deep" net.

**If this is not clear, try:**
```python
for idx, l in enumerate(deep_mlp.layers):
    print(f"Layer {idx} mean abs grad: {l.weight.grad.abs().mean().item()}")
```
after `.backward()`.

---

**TL;DR:**  
`l` is each hidden `nn.Linear` layer, so `l.weight.grad.abs().mean()` gives that layer’s mean absolute gradient. The code is correct!

Let me know if you need further details, an annotated code snippet, or another example!

# === USER ===

ok, there's still something wrong. in this code:

    mean_grad = torch.stack([l.weight.grad.abs().mean() for l in deep_mlp.layers]).mean().item()

l.weight and l.weight.grad can be either a Module or a Tensor. this is causing a problem. i think you can only call .grad on a tensor, not a module. this is messing with the type safety system. can we fix this somehow? can we guarantee it is a tensor?

# === ASSISTANT ===

You're absolutely right:  
- **`l` is an `nn.Linear` module.**  
- **`l.weight` is a `torch.nn.Parameter` (which subclasses `Tensor`)**  
- **`l.weight.grad` is a Tensor OR `None` (if not yet computed or if gradients haven't been computed through `l`).**

If you get an error, it's likely because:
- **`l.weight.grad` is `None` (e.g., for the first iteration, or if that layer didn’t participate in the forward/backward pass),**
- or (if using type checking tools) the type system can't guarantee that `.grad` is not `None`.

## Solution: Check for `None`

You can **filter out None grads** (and optionally skip or set to zero) so the type checker and numerical code are both happy.

### Option 1 (Skip Layers with No Grad):

```python
grads = [g.abs().mean() for l in deep_mlp.layers if (g := l.weight.grad) is not None]
if grads:  # If at least one grad exists
    mean_grad = torch.stack(grads).mean().item()
else:
    mean_grad = 0.0
```

### Option 2 (Zero for Missing Grads):

```python
grads = [
    l.weight.grad.abs().mean() if l.weight.grad is not None
    else torch.tensor(0.0)
    for l in deep_mlp.layers
]
mean_grad = torch.stack(grads).mean().item()
```

## Why This Works
- **`l.weight` is a Parameter → always a Tensor.**
- **`.grad` is only populated after `.backward()`.**  
- **But type checkers see `.grad` as `Optional[Tensor]`.** Explicitly handle `None` for correct, robust code.

## Final Correct Example

```python
mean_grad: float = torch.stack([
    l.weight.grad.abs().mean() if l.weight.grad is not None else torch.tensor(0.0)
    for l in deep_mlp.layers
]).mean().item()
```

Or, for Python 3.8+ with the walrus operator:

```python
mean_grad: float = torch.stack([
    g.abs().mean() for l in deep_mlp.layers if (g := l.weight.grad) is not None
]).mean().item() if any(l.weight.grad is not None for l in deep_mlp.layers) else 0.0
```

## Type Safety

This guarantees:
- `.grad` is always a `Tensor` before calling `.abs()` and `.mean()`
- Your code is robust for both the Python type system *and* runtime.

---

**Summary:**  
Always test `if l.weight.grad is not None` before using `.abs()` etc. That will keep both the type checker and runtime happy.

# === ASSISTANT ===

Absolutely, you are correct to be cautious here. In practice, type checkers and linters *do* get confused with "l.weight.grad" because `.grad` is an Optional[Tensor]: it can be `None`.  
But the real tricky part is: if for some reason, a layer hasn't received a gradient (e.g., was never used in the forward pass, or in the first backward pass), then `l.weight.grad` is indeed `None`.

However, you can write robust, type-safe code **without any walrus operator** or advanced tricks, and without type confusion, by directly using the model's `.parameters()` iterator and filtering for weight tensors, NOT using `l.weight` at all:

### Best PyTorch Practice: Use `model.parameters()` Directly

All weight and bias tensors are already exposed via `.parameters()`, and this is always a generator of `Tensor`s or `Parameter`s. This sidesteps potential typing/attribute issues with module instances.

#### Here’s the most robust, type-safe way:

```python
# ...inside your loop after .backward():
grads = []
for param in deep_mlp.parameters():
    if param.grad is not None:
        grads.append(param.grad.detach().abs().mean())
if grads:
    mean_grad = torch.stack(grads).mean().item()
else:
    mean_grad = 0.0
grad_hist.append(mean_grad)
```

- **Why is this safer?**  
  - You are never accessing `.weight` or `.weight.grad` through the submodule (i.e., the type checker/linters know all `.parameters()` are Tensors).
  - You always check for `None` before accessing `.abs()`, so this works on freshly initialized models before any gradient pass.

#### Full replacement in your loop:
```python
for epoch in range(30):
    logits = deep_mlp(X)
    loss = F.cross_entropy(logits, y)
    opt.zero_grad()
    loss.backward()
    grads = [
        param.grad.detach().abs().mean()
        for param in deep_mlp.parameters()
        if param.grad is not None
    ]
    mean_grad = torch.stack(grads).mean().item() if grads else 0.0
    grad_hist.append(mean_grad)
    opt.step()
```

#### If You Want *Only Hidden Layer* Gradients:
If you only want to average over gradients for *hidden* layers (i.e., not output layer), you could:

```python
hidden_params = [l.weight for l in deep_mlp.layers]
grads = [p.grad.detach().abs().mean() for p in hidden_params if p.grad is not None]
mean_grad = torch.stack(grads).mean().item() if grads else 0.0
```

This guarantees `p` is a `Parameter` (i.e., a Tensor), and avoids ever referencing a Module directly when not appropriate.

---

### **TL;DR**

- Do **not** use `l.weight.grad` directly unless you guarantee `l` is a `nn.Linear` and that gradients always exist.
- Use `model.parameters()` and check for `param.grad is not None`—that’s the PyTorch idiom and is always type safe.

- [PyTorch Best Practices FAQ](https://pytorch.org/tutorials/beginner/nn_tutorial.html)

---

**Summary of Solution:**  
> Use `for param in model.parameters():` to iterate, check for `param.grad is not None`, and access `.abs().mean()` on the gradient tensor.

## Introduction

Now that you can build and train neural networks, you need to learn the art of **generalization**. A powerful model is not useful unless it does well on *new data*! In machine learning and RL, two classic “fail states” appear: **overfitting** and **underfitting**. Mastery of these—and their fixes—makes your models reliable in the wild.

In this post, you'll:

- Fit and compare models on small (overfit-prone) vs. large (underfit-prone) datasets.
- Add noise and see how it tempts your model to memorize rather than generalize.
- Apply **L2 regularization** ("weight decay") to reduce overfitting.
- Experimentally vary model complexity and measure the effect on accuracy.

---

## Mathematics: Overfitting, Underfitting, and L2 Regularization

- **Overfitting:** Model fits training set *too* closely, including noise. Train loss $\to 0$ but test loss $\gg 0$.
- **Underfitting:** Model is too simple to capture the true pattern. Both losses are high.
- **The solution:** Find a model that minimizes *test loss*, not just train loss.

### Losses (Train/Test)

Given:
- **Train loss:** $L_{\text{train}} = \frac{1}{N_\text{train}} \sum_{i=1}^{N_\text{train}} L(y_i, \hat{y}_i)$
- **Test loss:** $L_{\text{test}} = \frac{1}{N_\text{test}} \sum_{i=1}^{N_\text{test}} L(y_j, \hat{y}_j)$

### L2 Regularization (Weight Decay)

Add a penalty to loss for large weights:

$$
L_{\text{total}} = L_{\text{original}} + \lambda \sum_{k} w_k^2
$$

- $\lambda > 0$ is the regularization strength.
- Penalizes “complex” (high-magnitude) weights, encouraging simplicity.

---

## Explanation: How the Math Connects to Code

In code, you handle generalization by:

- **Splitting data:** Train your model on a subset (train set), but judge performance on *unseen* data (test set).
- **Overfitting/underfitting detection:** Plot *both* train and test loss as training progresses.
    - Overfitting: training loss plunges, test loss climbs.
    - Underfitting: both losses high or stagnant.
- **L2 regularization:** In PyTorch, set `weight_decay` in your optimizer, or manually add to the loss during training.
- **Model complexity:** Experiment with small/large nets or high/low degree polynomials, and see how flexibility relates to overfitting/underfitting.

You’ll see these phenomena visually—crucial for practical RL and ML development.

### **Exercise 1:** Fit a Model to Small and Large Datasets, Plot Train/Test Loss

- Generate two datasets: one small (e.g., $N=20$) and one large (e.g., $N=100$), from a nonlinear true function (e.g., $\sin(x) + 0.5x$).
- Train a small neural net on the small set, and evaluate loss on the large test set each epoch.
- Plot and compare train vs. test loss.

---

### **Exercise 2:** Add Noise to Data and Visualize Overfitting

- Add more noise to your training set.
- Retrain your model and plot losses.
- Visualize predictions on the test set and training data.

---

### **Exercise 3:** Apply L2 Regularization and Observe the Effect

- Retrain your model on noisy data, varying `weight_decay` in the optimizer (e.g., 0, 0.01, 0.1).
- Compare test set loss over epochs.

---

### **Exercise 4:** Vary Model Complexity and Record Accuracy

- For several hidden layer widths (e.g., 2, 8, 16, 32, 64), train and evaluate models.
- For each, compute test $R^2$ or accuracy.

## Introduction

By now, you’ve learned why **regularization** is essential in machine learning: without it, neural networks can memorize their training data and fail to generalize. PyTorch offers built-in tools for regularization, from **dropout layers** to **L2 (weight decay)** and more. In this post you’ll:

- Implement dropout and weight decay in PyTorch models.
- Visualize how regularization improves model generalization.
- Compare models with and without regularization.
- Experiment with dropout rates and interpret their effects.

---

## Mathematics: Dropout, L2, and Regularization Concepts

**L2 Regularization (Weight Decay):**
- Adds a penalty term to the loss that suppresses large weights:
  $$
  L_{\text{total}} = L_{\text{original}} + \lambda \sum_{i=1}^{N} w_i^2
  $$
- PyTorch implements this via the `weight_decay` parameter in optimizers.

**Dropout:**
- In training, randomly sets a fraction $p$ of activations to zero at each layer per batch:
  $$
  h_{\text{drop}} = \mathbf{d} \odot h, \quad \mathbf{d} \sim \text{Bernoulli}(1-p)
  $$
- At test time, all neurons are used (scaling is applied automatically).
- Dropout acts as model bagging—makes the network robust to missing features/nodes.

**The effect:** Both L2 and dropout combat overfitting by “simplifying” the model and preventing reliance on any one parameter or path.

---

## Explanation: How the Math Connects to Code

In practice with PyTorch:

- **L2 Regularization:** Set `weight_decay=λ` in your optimizer. PyTorch automatically adds $λ \sum w_i^2$ to the loss.
- **Dropout:** Insert `nn.Dropout(p)` layers after any linear or activation layer. During training, each forward pass zeroes out different random units—at inference, dropout is disabled.
- **Validation splitting:** Hold out a fraction of your data as the "validation set" (unseen during training) so you can meaningfully evaluate generalization under various regularization schemes.
- PyTorch handles all state switching for Dropout between `.train()` and `.eval()`, so you get correct behavior during training and test.

Using these tools, you’ll see how accuracy and generalization improve or degrade as you tweak regularization strength or dropout rate.

## Introduction

Let’s bring together the skills you’ve developed so far and apply them to an iconic deep learning task: **classifying handwritten digits** with the MNIST dataset. In this mini-project, you will:

- Download & load the MNIST dataset using PyTorch’s torchvision.
- Build and train a shallow neural network to recognize digits 0–9.
- Evaluate model performance with a confusion matrix.
- Visualize both correct and incorrect predictions directly from the images.

By running through these classic steps, you’ll learn core deep learning workflow skills transferrable to RL, vision, and more.

## Mathematics: Classification with Shallow Neural Nets

**MNIST** images are $28\times28$ grayscale images—each a vector $x\in\mathbb{R}^{784}$.

A simple neural classifier:
- **Input Layer:** Flattened image ($784$ features)
- **Hidden Layer:** E.g., $H=128$ units, ReLU activation
- **Output Layer:** $10$ units, softmax activation (one per digit)

**Forward pass:**
\[
\begin{align*}
h &= \mathrm{ReLU}(Wx + b) \\
\hat{y} &= \mathrm{softmax}(Wh + b)
\end{align*}
\]

**Loss:**  
Use cross-entropy loss for classification:
\[
L = -\sum_{k=0}^9 y_k \log \hat{y}_k
\]
where $y_k$ is the one-hot label.

**Accuracy:**  
\[
\mathrm{acc} = \frac{\text{\# correct predictions}}{\text{total predictions}}
\]

## Explanation: How the Math Connects to Code

- **Data loading:** Use PyTorch’s torchvision.datasets to download and access images and labels as Tensors.
- **Model:** Compose layers with `nn.Sequential` or subclass `nn.Module`. For a shallow net, often one hidden layer is enough for MNIST to reach 97%+ accuracy.
- **Training:** Use cross-entropy loss and an optimizer (e.g., Adam or SGD).
- **Evaluation:** Track accuracy per epoch. Build a confusion matrix for more insight—this shows which digits are misclassified.
- **Visualization:** Use matplotlib to display sample images, including which predictions were correct and which weren’t.

You’re ready to scale up to deeper models or leverage these skills for RL agents with real, raw input. If you’ve never built a deep learning app before, this is a firm step into the practical world.

## Introduction

At this point, you’ve mastered PyTorch and deep neural networks for supervised tasks. But what happens when you don’t have a dataset of “inputs and targets”—when learning is driven by **interaction** and **feedback**, not labeled answers? Welcome to **Reinforcement Learning (RL)**.

In this article, you’ll:

- Understand what RL is and how it differs fundamentally from supervised and unsupervised learning.
- Simulate a simple agent/environment loop.
- Assign rewards to actions in a toy world.
- See and compare code patterns between supervised learning, unsupervised learning, and RL.
- Visualize how an agent’s experience and reward evolve over time.

---

## Mathematics: RL vs. Supervised/Unsupervised

**Supervised Learning:**
- You’re given a dataset $\{(x_i, y_i)\}_{i=1}^N$ of (input, target) pairs.
- The learning objective is usually to minimize:
  $$
  L_\text{sup} = \frac{1}{N} \sum_{i=1}^N \ell(f(x_i), y_i)
  $$
  where $\ell$ is a loss function (e.g., cross-entropy, MSE).

**Unsupervised Learning:**
- You’re only given $\{x_i\}_{i=1}^N$, no targets.
- You might organize, cluster, or compress data by optimizing:
  $$
  L_\text{unsup} = \frac{1}{N} \sum_{i=1}^N \ell_\text{unsup}(f(x_i))
  $$
  Examples: K-means, PCA, autoencoders.

**Reinforcement Learning:**
- An **agent** interacts with an **environment**, receiving state $s_t$, taking action $a_t$, getting reward $r_t$ and new state $s_{t+1}$:
  $$
  \text{Loop:} \quad s_t \xrightarrow{a_t} (r_t,\, s_{t+1})
  $$
- The agent’s objective is to *maximize total return* (often, discounted sum of rewards):
  $$
  G_t = r_t + \gamma r_{t+1} + \gamma^2 r_{t+2} + \dotsb
  $$
- There is no ground truth "target" for each state—the agent *discovers* effective behaviors through feedback.

---

## Explanation: The Essence of RL

- **Supervised:** Learn to map $x$ to $y$, with direct ground truth, and “one-shot” feedback per data sample.
- **Unsupervised:** Find structure in $x$ alone (no $y$).
- **RL:** Learn by **trial and error** in a live loop; feedback (reward) is delayed and sparse, and the “right” actions may not be immediately obvious!

**Key RL workflow:**
- Start with an initial state $s_0$.
- Repeatedly, the agent chooses action $a_t$, gets reward $r_t$, moves to $s_{t+1}$ (from the environment).
- The agent “learns from experience,” adapting its policy to maximize *future* reward.

This is a natural fit for games, robotics, and many self-improving systems.

---

## Python Demonstrations

### Demo 1: Simulate an Agent-Environment Loop and Print State Transitions

Let’s make a tiny gridworld with 3 states (`0`, `1`, `2`), and two actions: “right” and “left.” The agent can move right (`+1`) or left (`-1`). If it reaches the end (`2`), it gets a reward of +1; at `0`, a penalty of -1.

```python
import random

class TinyEnv:
    def __init__(self) -> None:
        self.state: int = 1   # start in middle
        self.terminal: bool = False
    def reset(self) -> int:
        self.state = 1
        self.terminal = False
        return self.state
    def step(self, action: int) -> tuple[int, float, bool]:
        # action: 0=left, 1=right
        if action == 0:
            self.state -= 1
        else:
            self.state += 1
        if self.state <= 0:
            reward = -1.0
            self.terminal = True
            self.state = 0
        elif self.state >= 2:
            reward = +1.0
            self.terminal = True
            self.state = 2
        else:
            reward = 0.0
        return self.state, reward, self.terminal

env = TinyEnv()
state = env.reset()
print("start state:", state)
for t in range(10):
    action = random.choice([0, 1])        # random left/right
    new_state, reward, done = env.step(action)
    print(f"t={t}: action={action}, state={new_state}, reward={reward}")
    if done:
        print("Episode done!")
        break
```

---

### Demo 2: Assign Rewards to Agent Actions in a Toy Environment

Let’s try a hand-made policy: always go right!

```python
env = TinyEnv()
state = env.reset()
total_reward = 0
print("Policy: always go right")
for t in range(10):
    action = 1      # always right
    new_state, reward, done = env.step(action)
    print(f"t={t}: action={action}, state={new_state}, reward={reward}")
    total_reward += reward
    if done:
        print("Episode done with total reward:", total_reward)
        break
```
Try setting `action = 0` ("left") for a different outcome and see the reward!

---

### Demo 3: Compare Supervised, Unsupervised, and RL Code Snippets

**Supervised:**

```python
# Given (x, y) pairs, optimize for y
x_data = [0, 1, 2, 3]
y_data = [0, 1, 4, 9]
def supervised_train(x, y):
    model_output = [i**2 for i in x]
    loss = sum((y1 - y2)**2 for y1, y2 in zip(model_output, y))
    print("Supervised Loss:", loss)
supervised_train(x_data, y_data)
```

**Unsupervised:**

```python
# Given only x, cluster/group/transform
x_data = [0.5, 1.5, 3.2, 8.1, 9.3]
def unsupervised_task(x):
    center = sum(x)/len(x)
    clusters = [0 if xi < center else 1 for xi in x]
    print("Unsupervised clusters:", clusters)
unsupervised_task(x_data)
```

**Reinforcement Learning:**

```python
# Agent interacts and gets feedback as reward
env = TinyEnv()
state = env.reset()
total_reward = 0
for t in range(5):
    action = random.choice([0, 1])
    state, reward, done = env.step(action)
    total_reward += reward
    if done:
        break
print("RL: total reward from one trajectory:", total_reward)
```

---

### Demo 4: Plot Agent Total Reward Over Time for a Simple Policy

Let’s run many episodes and plot the cumulative reward a random agent gets:

```python
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

episodes = 100
ep_rewards = []
for _ in range(episodes):
    env = TinyEnv()
    state = env.reset()
    total = 0
    for t in range(10):
        action = random.choice([0, 1])
        state, reward, done = env.step(action)
        total += reward
        if done:
            break
    ep_rewards.append(total)
plt.plot(ep_rewards)
plt.xlabel("Episode")
plt.ylabel("Total Reward")
plt.title("Random Agent Reward over Episodes")
plt.grid(True)
plt.show()
```

Try swapping in a fixed policy (`action = 1`) to see how performance changes.

---

## Exercises

### **Exercise 1:** Simulate an Agent-Environment Loop and Print State Transitions

- Define a toy environment: finite states, a reset function, a step function that changes the state, and a termination condition.
- Have an agent take random actions, and print state, action, reward, and done status at every step.

---

### **Exercise 2:** Assign Rewards to Agent Actions in a Toy Environment

- Hardcode a simple policy (always left, always right, or alternate).
- Try different starting states or rules, and see how total reward or end state changes.

---

### **Exercise 3:** Compare Supervised, Unsupervised, and RL Code Snippets

- Write minimal code implementing a:
    - Supervised mapping ($x \rightarrow y$)
    - Unsupervised grouping (cluster)
    - RL feedback loop (action, reward, state transition)
- Discuss/observe the difference in inputs, outputs, and feedback.

---

### **Exercise 4:** Plot Agent's Total Reward Over Time for a Simple Policy

- For 50+ episodes, have the agent follow a fixed or random policy.
- Record total per-episode reward.
- Plot reward vs. episode, and see if any patterns/trends emerge.

---

### **Sample Starter Code for Exercises**

```python
import random
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

class MiniEnv:
    def __init__(self) -> None:
        self.state = 1
        self.done = False
    def reset(self) -> int:
        self.state = 1
        self.done = False
        return self.state
    def step(self, action: int) -> tuple[int, float, bool]:
        if action == 0: self.state -= 1
        else: self.state += 1
        if self.state <= 0:
            self.state = 0; self.done = True; return self.state, -1.0, True
        if self.state >= 2:
            self.state = 2; self.done = True; return self.state, 1.0, True
        return self.state, 0.0, False

# Exercise 1/2
env = MiniEnv()
state = env.reset()
for t in range(8):
    action = 1 if t%2==0 else 0 # alternate
    next_state, reward, done = env.step(action)
    print(f"t={t}, state={next_state}, reward={reward}, done={done}")
    if done: break

# Exercise 3 - All three paradigms
# (see above Demos for code)

# Exercise 4
ep_rewards = []
for ep in range(60):
    env = MiniEnv()
    state = env.reset()
    total = 0
    for t in range(10):
        action = random.choice([0, 1])
        state, reward, done = env.step(action)
        total += reward
        if done: break
    ep_rewards.append(total)
plt.plot(ep_rewards)
plt.xlabel("Episode"); plt.ylabel("Total Reward")
plt.title("Random Policy, Per-Episode Reward"); plt.show()
```

## Introduction

All of reinforcement learning is built on the formal concept of a **Markov Decision Process (MDP)**. MDPs provide the mathematical framework underlying RL algorithms—from basic tabular Q-learning to modern deep RL.

In this post, you will:

- Define the components and math of an MDP
- Implement a custom MDP as Python code
- Simulate random and simple policies, measuring their performance
- Visualize MDP state transitions as a graph
- Lay the groundwork for value functions and policy improvement

---

## Mathematics: Markov Decision Processes

An **MDP** is defined by the tuple $(\mathcal{S}, \mathcal{A}, P, R, \gamma)$:

- $S$ — set of **states**: $s \in \mathcal{S}$
- $A$ — set of **actions**: $a \in \mathcal{A}$
- $P$ — **transition probabilities**: $P(s'|s,a)$, probability of moving to $s'$ from $s$ when taking action $a$
- $R$ — **reward function**: $R(s,a)$ or $R(s,a,s')$, expected immediate reward
- $\gamma$ — **discount factor**: $0 \leq \gamma \leq 1$

**Agent-Environment Loop:**
At each timestep $t$:
\[
s_t \xrightarrow{a_t} (r_t, s_{t+1})
\]
The agent picks action $a_t$ in state $s_t$, the environment returns reward $r_t$ and the next state $s_{t+1}$ according to $P$ and $R$.

**Policy:** $\pi(a|s)$ gives the probability the agent chooses action $a$ in state $s$.

**Expected Return:** $G_t = r_t + \gamma r_{t+1} + \gamma^2 r_{t+2} + \dots$

---

## Explanation: How the Math Connects to Code

- **States/Actions:** In code, these are discrete objects (integers or strings), usually represented with lists or enums.
- **Transitions:** Store as a dictionary mapping $(s, a)$ pairs to possible next states and their probabilities.
- **Rewards:** Also as a dict for specific $(s, a, s')$ transitions.
- **Policies:** Can be random (uniform), fixed (always one action), or probabilistic (describe action choice by state).

By implementing an MDP in Python, you can simulate any RL task with known ground truth and test various policies systematically.

---

## Python Demonstrations

### Demo 1: Define a Small MDP as Python Data Structures

We'll define a tiny 3-state MDP with 2 actions.

```python
from typing import Dict, Tuple, List
import numpy as np

states: List[str] = ['A', 'B', 'C']
actions: List[str] = ['left', 'right']

# Transition probabilities: P[s][a] = list of (prob, next_state)
P: Dict[str, Dict[str, List[Tuple[float, str]]]] = {
    'A': {'left':  [(1.0, 'A')],
          'right': [(1.0, 'B')]},
    'B': {'left':  [(0.8, 'A'), (0.2, 'C')],
          'right': [(1.0, 'C')]},
    'C': {'left':  [(1.0, 'B')],
          'right': [(1.0, 'C')]}
}

# Rewards: R[s][a][s'] = reward  
R: Dict[str, Dict[str, Dict[str, float]]] = {
    'A': {'left':  {'A': 0.0},
          'right': {'B': 1.0}},
    'B': {'left':  {'A': 0.0, 'C': 2.0},
          'right': {'C': 3.0}},
    'C': {'left':  {'B': 0.0},
          'right': {'C': 0.0}}
}
gamma: float = 0.9
```

---

### Demo 2: Simulate a Random Policy and Track Rewards

Let's run episodes under a random policy (choose actions uniformly in each state).

```python
import random

def sample_next_state(s: str, a: str) -> str:
    p_list = P[s][a]
    probs, next_states = zip(*[(p, s2) for p, s2 in p_list])
    return random.choices(next_states, weights=probs)[0]

def get_reward(s: str, a: str, s2: str) -> float:
    return R[s][a][s2]

def run_episode(policy: Dict[str, str | None] = None, max_steps: int = 10) -> float:

        s2 = sample_next_state(s, a)
        r = get_reward(s, a, s2)
        total_reward += r
        trajectory.append((s, a, r, s2))
        s = s2
    print("Trajectory:", trajectory)
    print("Total reward:", total_reward)
    return total_reward

ep_rewards = [run_episode() for _ in range(5)]
print("Average reward:", np.mean(ep_rewards))
```

### Demo 3: Visualize State Transitions as a Graph

We'll use `networkx` to show how each (state, action) leads to other states.

```python
import networkx as nx
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

G = nx.MultiDiGraph()
for s in P:
    for a in P[s]:
        for prob, s2 in P[s][a]:
            label = f"{a} ({prob})"
            G.add_edge(s, s2, label=label)

pos = nx.spring_layout(G, seed=1)
plt.figure(figsize=(5,4))
nx.draw(G, pos, with_labels=True, node_size=1200, node_color="skyblue", font_weight="bold")
edge_labels = {(u,v,k['label']):k['label'] for u,v,k in G.edges(data=True)}
edge_labels = {(u,v): d['label'] for u,v,d in G.edges(data=True)}
nx.draw_networkx_edge_labels(G, pos, edge_labels=edge_labels, font_size=9)
plt.title("MDP State Transition Graph")
plt.show()
```

---

### Demo 4: Implement a Simple Policy and Compute Expected Reward

Let's try a greedy policy: always take `"right"`.

```python
# Define a deterministic policy
simple_policy = {s: "right" for s in states}

# Run several episodes and compute average reward
rewards_right = [run_episode(simple_policy) for _ in range(20)]
print("Right-only policy: avg reward =", np.mean(rewards_right))

# Try left-only for contrast
left_policy = {s: "left" for s in states}
rewards_left = [run_episode(left_policy) for _ in range(20)]
print("Left-only policy: avg reward =", np.mean(rewards_left))
```

## Introduction

One of the most iconic settings in reinforcement learning is the **multi-armed bandit** problem. Here, you repeatedly choose between several noisy options (“arms”), each with an unknown reward distribution. The catch? You must **balance exploration** (learning about arms) and **exploitation** (favoring what works best so far).

Bandits are the simplest setting for exploring “exploration vs. exploitation”—a core problem in RL and real-world decision-making (ads, A/B tests, drug trials, online recommendations…).

In this post, you’ll:

- Build and visualize a multi-armed bandit environment.
- Implement and compare classic exploration strategies: epsilon-greedy, UCB, and Thompson Sampling.
- Track arm selections, rewards, and learning curves.
- See all code in clear, reproducible PyTorch/Numpy demos.

---

## Mathematics: Bandit Setting and Exploration Strategies

**Multi-armed Bandit:**  
- $K$ arms, each with an unknown (often stationary) reward distribution $R_k$.
- At each time $t$, you pick arm $a_t \in \{1,...,K\}$, and observe random reward $r_t \sim R_{a_t}$.

**Goal:** Maximize expected total reward; equivalently, minimize **regret** versus always picking the best arm.

### **Epsilon-Greedy Policy**

- With probability $\varepsilon$, pick an arm *at random* (**explore**).
- Otherwise, pick the arm with highest average observed reward (**exploit**).

### **Upper Confidence Bound (UCB)**

For each arm $k$:
\[
Q_k(t) + c \sqrt{\frac{\ln t}{N_k(t)}}
\]
- Exploit arms with higher estimates $Q_k(t)$, but also explore arms with fewer pulls $N_k(t)$.

### **Thompson Sampling**

- Maintain a belief over the parameters of the reward distribution for each arm.
- Sample from each belief, pick the arm with the highest sampled value.
- E.g., for Bernoulli rewards, use a Beta posterior: Beta($\alpha_k$, $\beta_k$).

---

## Explanation: How the Math Connects to Code

- **Reward Distributions:** For each arm, define a true but hidden mean and sample actual rewards each pull.
- **Agent Estimates:** Track per-arm counts and average rewards.
- **Policies:**
    - *Epsilon-greedy:* select random vs. best.
    - *UCB:* use a confidence upper bound to bias towards least tried arms.
    - *Thompson Sampling:* update a Beta prior after each observation, then sample from this prior.
- **Metrics/Visualization:** Plot histograms of arm means, arm selection frequencies, average reward over time (the “learning curve”).

---

## Python Demonstrations

### Demo 1: Simulate a Multi-Armed Bandit and Plot Arm Payout Distributions

```python
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

class BanditEnv:
    def __init__(self, K: int = 5) -> None:
        self.K = K
        self.true_means = np.random.uniform(0, 1, K)
    def pull(self, arm: int) -> float:
        # Rewards are Gaussian around each mean
        return np.random.normal(self.true_means[arm], 0.1)
    def plot_distributions(self) -> None:
        for k, mu in enumerate(self.true_means):
            xs = np.linspace(0, 1.5, 100)
            ys = 1/np.sqrt(2*np.pi*0.1**2) * np.exp(-(xs-mu)**2/(2*0.1**2))
            plt.plot(xs, ys, label=f"Arm {k} (mean={mu:.2f})")
        plt.legend()
        plt.title("Bandit Arm Reward Distributions")
        plt.ylabel("Density")
        plt.xlabel("Reward")
        plt.show()

env = BanditEnv(K=5)
print("True arm means:", np.round(env.true_means, 2))
env.plot_distributions()
```

---

### Demo 2: Implement Epsilon-Greedy Policy and Track Arm Selections

```python
np.random.seed(17)

K = 5
env = BanditEnv(K)
n_steps = 300
eps = 0.1

counts = np.zeros(K, dtype=int)         # Number of times each arm was pulled
values = np.zeros(K)                    # Empirical mean reward for each arm
selections = np.zeros(K, dtype=int)     # For stats

rewards = []

for t in range(1, n_steps+1):
    if np.random.rand() < eps:
        arm = np.random.choice(K)
    else:
        arm = np.argmax(values)
    reward = env.pull(arm)
    counts[arm] += 1
    selections[arm] += 1
    # Update running mean for empirical value
    values[arm] += (reward - values[arm]) / counts[arm]
    rewards.append(reward)

plt.bar(range(K), selections)
plt.xlabel("Arm")
plt.ylabel("# times selected")
plt.title(f"Arm Selection Counts (epsilon={eps})")
plt.show()

plt.title("Epsilon-Greedy: Average Reward Over Time")
plt.xlabel("Step")
plt.ylabel("Average Reward")
plt.show()
```

---

### Demo 3: Compare UCB and Thompson Sampling on the Same Problem

#### UCB

```python
def bandit_ucb(env: BanditEnv, n_steps: int = 300, c: float = 1.0) -> tuple[list[float], np.ndarray]:
    K = env.K
    counts = np.zeros(K)
    values = np.zeros(K)
    rewards = []
    selections = np.zeros(K, dtype=int)

    for t in range(1, n_steps+1):
        # Pull each arm once to start
        if t <= K:
            arm = t-1
        else:
            ucb = values + c * np.sqrt(np.log(t) / (counts + 1e-7))
            arm = np.argmax(ucb)
        reward = env.pull(arm)
        counts[arm] += 1
        selections[arm] += 1
        values[arm] += (reward - values[arm]) / counts[arm]
        rewards.append(reward)
    return rewards, selections

rewards_ucb, selections_ucb = bandit_ucb(env, n_steps)
plt.bar(range(K), selections_ucb)
plt.xlabel("Arm"); plt.ylabel("# chosen")
plt.title("UCB Selection")
plt.show()

plt.plot(np.cumsum(rewards_ucb) / (np.arange(n_steps) + 1), label="UCB")
```

#### Thompson Sampling (for Bernoulli Arms)

For demonstration, let’s use Bernoulli arms:

```python
class BernoulliBanditEnv:
    def __init__(self, K: int = 5) -> None:
        self.K = K
        self.true_means = np.random.uniform(0.1, 0.9, K)
    def pull(self, arm: int) -> int:
        return int(np.random.rand() < self.true_means[arm])
envb = BernoulliBanditEnv(K=5)

def bandit_thompson(env, n_steps=300) -> tuple[list[float], np.ndarray]:
    K = env.K
    alpha = np.ones(K)      # Successes + 1
    beta = np.ones(K)       # Failures + 1
    rewards = []
    selections = np.zeros(K, dtype=int)

    for t in range(n_steps):
        samples = np.random.beta(alpha, beta)
        arm = np.argmax(samples)
        reward = env.pull(arm)
        selections[arm] += 1
        if reward:
            alpha[arm] += 1
        else:
            beta[arm] += 1
        rewards.append(reward)
    return rewards, selections

rewards_th, selections_th = bandit_thompson(envb)
plt.bar(range(K), selections_th)
plt.xlabel("Arm"); plt.ylabel("# chosen")
plt.title("Thompson Sampling Selection")
plt.show()

plt.plot(np.cumsum(rewards_th)/ (np.arange(len(rewards_th)) + 1), label="Thompson")
plt.title("Average Reward Over Time")
plt.xlabel("Step"); plt.ylabel("Average Reward")
plt.legend(); plt.show()
```

---

### Demo 4: Plot Cumulative Reward for Different Strategies

Let's show learning curves side-by-side:

```python
# Use the same Bernoulli env for all methods for fair comparison
envb2 = BernoulliBanditEnv(K=5)
n_steps = 300

def bandit_eps_greedy(env, n_steps=300, eps=0.1):
    K = env.K
    counts = np.zeros(K)
    values = np.zeros(K)
    rewards = []
    for t in range(n_steps):
        if np.random.rand() < eps:
            arm = np.random.choice(K)
        else:
            arm = np.argmax(values)
        reward = env.pull(arm)
        counts[arm] += 1
        values[arm] += (reward - values[arm]) / counts[arm]
        rewards.append(reward)
    return rewards

rewards_eps = bandit_eps_greedy(envb2, n_steps=n_steps, eps=0.1)
rewards_ucb, _ = bandit_ucb(envb2, n_steps=n_steps, c=1.2)
rewards_th, _ = bandit_thompson(envb2, n_steps=n_steps)

plt.plot(np.cumsum(rewards_eps)/ (np.arange(n_steps) + 1), label="Epsilon-Greedy")
plt.plot(np.cumsum(rewards_ucb)/ (np.arange(n_steps) + 1), label="UCB")
plt.plot(np.cumsum(rewards_th)/ (np.arange(n_steps) + 1), label="Thompson")
plt.title("Cumulative Average Reward: Bandit Algorithms")
plt.xlabel("Step"); plt.ylabel("Avg Reward")
plt.legend(); plt.grid(True); plt.show()

## Introduction

After seeing bandits, let’s step up to environments where actions have **consequences across time**! In gridworlds and many RL classics, the key concept is the **Q-value**: estimating the *future value* of every action in every state.

In this post, you’ll:

- Implement a Q-table for a finite environment
- Run and compare **Q-learning** and **SARSA** on Gridworld
- Visualize Q-tables as heatmaps
- Animate an agent’s path following the learned policy
- (Project) Let a Q-learning agent master Taxi-v3

---

## Mathematics: Q-Learning and SARSA

### **Q-Value Definition**

The Q-value $Q(s,a)$ is the expected sum of discounted rewards from taking action $a$ in state $s$, and then following some policy thereafter.

### **Q-Learning (Off-policy)**

Update rule:
\[
Q(s, a) \leftarrow Q(s, a) + \alpha \Big[ r + \gamma \max_{a'} Q(s', a') - Q(s, a) \Big]
\]

- $\alpha$ — learning rate
- $\gamma$ — discount factor

### **SARSA (On-policy)**

Update rule:
\[
Q(s, a) \leftarrow Q(s, a) + \alpha \Big[r + \gamma Q(s', a') - Q(s, a)\Big]
\]
where $a'$ is the actual next action taken by the agent according to its policy.

- **Q-learning** learns from the best possible next action (greedy) regardless of what the agent actually does (off-policy).
- **SARSA** learns from what the agent *actually does* (on-policy).

---

## Explanation: How the Math Connects to Code

- **Q-table**: A 2D array or dictionary storing the estimated $Q(s,a)$ for every $(s,a)$.
- **Epsilon-greedy policy**: Choose the best action most of the time, but sometimes pick randomly to explore.
- **Episode loop**: At each step, update the Q-table using either Q-learning or SARSA rules.
- **Visualization**: Use matplotlib to display the Q-values (for a gridworld, as a heatmap), and to animate learned behavior.

---

## Python Demonstrations

### Demo 1: Implement a Q-table for a Small Discrete Environment

Let’s use a tiny Gridworld with 4 states and 2 actions (LEFT, RIGHT):

```python
import numpy as np

n_states = 4
n_actions = 2
Q = np.zeros((n_states, n_actions))  # Q[state, action]

print("Initial Q-table:")
print(Q)
```

### Demo 2: Run Q-learning and SARSA on Gridworld; Compare Convergence

Let’s define a small Gridworld, reward at the end, with transitions:

```python
import random

class SimpleGridEnv:
    def __init__(self, n=4):
        self.n = n
        self.reset()
    def reset(self) -> int:
        self.s = 0
        return self.s
    def step(self, a: int) -> tuple[int, float, bool]:
        # a: 0=LEFT, 1=RIGHT
        if a == 1:
            self.s += 1
        else:
            self.s -= 1
        self.s = np.clip(self.s, 0, self.n-1)
        reward = 1.0 if self.s == self.n-1 else 0.0
        done = self.s == self.n-1
        return self.s, reward, done

def epsilon_greedy(Q, s, eps=0.2):
    if random.random() < eps:
        return random.choice(range(n_actions))
    return int(np.argmax(Q[s]))

def train_q(env, Q, episodes=250, alpha=0.1, gamma=0.9, eps=0.2):
    returns = []
    for ep in range(episodes):
        s = env.reset()
        done = False
        total = 0.
        while not done:
            a = epsilon_greedy(Q, s, eps)
            s2, r, done = env.step(a)
            Q[s, a] += alpha * (r + gamma * np.max(Q[s2]) - Q[s, a])  # Q-learning update
            s = s2
            total += r
        returns.append(total)
    return np.array(returns)

def train_sarsa(env, Q, episodes=250, alpha=0.1, gamma=0.9, eps=0.2):
    returns = []
    for ep in range(episodes):
        s = env.reset()
        a = epsilon_greedy(Q, s, eps)
        done = False
        total = 0.
        while not done:
            s2, r, done = env.step(a)
            a2 = epsilon_greedy(Q, s2, eps)
            Q[s, a] += alpha * (r + gamma * Q[s2, a2] - Q[s, a])  # SARSA update
            s = s2
            a = a2
            total += r
        returns.append(total)
    return np.array(returns)

env = SimpleGridEnv(n_states)
Q1 = np.zeros((n_states, n_actions))
Q2 = np.zeros((n_states, n_actions))
rets1 = train_q(env, Q1)

plt.ylabel("Mean Return"); plt.xlabel("Episode")
plt.legend(); plt.title("Q-Learning vs SARSA (Gridworld)")
plt.grid(); plt.show()
```

### Demo 3: Visualize the Learned Q-table as a Heatmap

```python
from matplotlib import pyplot as plt

plt.imshow(Q1, cmap='cool', interpolation='nearest')
plt.colorbar(label="Q-value")
plt.title("Q-table for Q-learning (States x Actions)")
plt.xlabel("Action (0=Left, 1=Right)")
plt.ylabel("State")
plt.show()
```

### Demo 4: Animate Agent’s Trajectory Using the Learned Policy

```python
import time

def run_policy(env, Q, max_steps=10, delay=0.4) -> None:
    s = env.reset()
    traj = [s]
    for _ in range(max_steps):
        a = int(np.argmax(Q[s]))
        s2, r, done = env.step(a)
        traj.append(s2)
        print(f"State: {s} -> Action: {a} -> State: {s2} | Reward: {r}")
        s = s2
        if done:
            break
        time.sleep(delay)
    print("Trajectory:", traj)

print("Animating Q-learning policy:")
run_policy(env, Q1)
```

### Project Exercise: Train a Q-Learning Agent on Taxi-v3 and Report Average Episode Length

Taxi-v3 is a classic Gym environment—use Q-learning to learn its optimal policy!

```python
import gymnasium as gym
import numpy as np

env = gym.make("Taxi-v3", render_mode="ansi")
n_states = env.observation_space.n
n_actions = env.action_space.n

Q = np.zeros((n_states, n_actions))
episodes = 1800
alpha = 0.1
gamma = 0.98
eps = 0.15

lengths = []
for ep in range(episodes):
    s, _ = env.reset()
    done = False
    count = 0
    while not done:
        if np.random.rand() < eps:
            a = np.random.randint(n_actions)
        else:
            a = np.argmax(Q[s])
        s2, r, terminated, truncated, _ = env.step(a)
        done = terminated or truncated
        Q[s, a] += alpha * (r + gamma * np.max(Q[s2]) - Q[s, a])
        s = s2
        count += 1
    lengths.append(count)

import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
plt.plot(np.convolve(lengths, np.ones(50)/50, mode='valid'))
plt.xlabel("Episode")
plt.ylabel("Episode Length")
plt.title("Taxi-v3: Q-Learning Episode Length (lower is better)")
plt.show()
print("Mean episode length (last 100 episodes):", np.mean(lengths[-100:]))
```

## Exercises

### **Exercise 1:** Implement a Q-table for a Small Discrete Environment

- Create a 2D array or dictionary `Q[s, a]` with zeros.
- Print it to check shape and initial values.

---

### **Exercise 2:** Run Q-learning and SARSA on Gridworld, Compare Convergence

- Train Q-learning and SARSA separately on the same gridworld.
- Plot mean reward over time for both methods.

---

### **Exercise 3:** Visualize the Learned Q-table as a Heatmap

- After learning, plot `Q` (states by actions) as an imshow/heatmap.
- Label axes for clarity.

---

### **Exercise 4:** Animate Agent’s Trajectory Using the Learned Policy

- For a trained policy (greedy from Q-table), print or animate state/action transitions from a start state.

---

### **Project Exercise:** Train a Q-learning Agent on Taxi-v3 and Report Average Episode Length

- Use Gymnasium’s `Taxi-v3` environment and Q-learning. Train for 1–2k episodes.
- Plot moving average of episode lengths.
- Report average over the last 100 episodes.

---

### **Sample Starter Code for Exercises**

```python
import numpy as np
import random
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Exercise 1
n_states, n_actions = 4, 2
Q = np.zeros((n_states, n_actions))
print(Q)

# Exercise 2/3
# (See above code!)
# Use SimpleGridEnv, epsilon_greedy, train_q, train_sarsa
# Plot learning curves and Q-table heatmap

# Exercise 4
env = SimpleGridEnv(n_states)
run_policy(env, Q1)
```

---

## Conclusion

You now know how to:
- Represent and learn Q-values in tabular environments
- Run and compare Q-learning (off-policy) and SARSA (on-policy)
- Visualize Q-tables and agent behavior

Next, you’ll see how random sampling and partial returns let us estimate value without knowing the environment—*Monte Carlo* and *TD* learning.

See you in Part 4.5!

in this code i'm getting the error that attribute n is unknown. how do i fix this? it's a type error. the code runs fine.

```python
import gymnasium as gym
import numpy as np

env = gym.make("Taxi-v3", render_mode="ansi")
n_states = env.observation_space.n
n_actions = env.action_space.n

Q = np.zeros((n_states, n_actions))
episodes = 1800
alpha = 0.1
gamma = 0.98
eps = 0.15

lengths = []
for ep in range(episodes):
    s, _ = env.reset()
    done = False
    count = 0
    while not done:
        if np.random.rand() < eps:
            a = np.random.randint(n_actions)
        else:
            a = np.argmax(Q[s])
        s2, r, terminated, truncated, _ = env.step(a)
        done = terminated or truncated
        Q[s, a] += alpha * (r + gamma * np.max(Q[s2]) - Q[s, a])
        s = s2
        count += 1
    lengths.append(count)

import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
plt.plot(np.convolve(lengths, np.ones(50)/50, mode='valid'))
plt.xlabel("Episode")
plt.ylabel("Episode Length")
plt.title("Taxi-v3: Q-Learning Episode Length (lower is better)")
plt.show()
print("Mean episode length (last 100 episodes):", np.mean(lengths[-100:]))
```

# === ASSISTANT ===

Great question—this is a common point of confusion when type checkers (like mypy, pylance, etc.) are used with OpenAI Gym/Gymnasium code.

Your code:
```python
n_states = env.observation_space.n
n_actions = env.action_space.n
```
runs fine because both `env.observation_space` and `env.action_space` are `Discrete` spaces, which indeed have an `n` attribute. But, **type checkers** can't guarantee that `env.observation_space` or `env.action_space` is always `Discrete` (could be `Box`, etc.), so they complain that the attribute `.n` isn't "known."

**In other words:**  
This is a *false positive* from static analysis tools, not a Python runtime issue!

---

## How to Silence or Fix the Type Error

### **Option 1: Type Ignore Comment (quick/friendly)**

```python
n_states = env.observation_space.n  # type: ignore
n_actions = env.action_space.n      # type: ignore
```

This tells type checkers to hush about `.n`.

---

### **Option 2: Cast to Discrete**

If you want to make the type checker happy, cast explicitly:

```python
from gymnasium.spaces import Discrete

n_states = (env.observation_space if isinstance(env.observation_space, Discrete) else None).n  # type: ignore
n_actions = (env.action_space if isinstance(env.action_space, Discrete) else None).n  # type: ignore
```
You could also:
```python
from gymnasium.spaces import Discrete

assert isinstance(env.observation_space, Discrete)
assert isinstance(env.action_space, Discrete)
n_states = env.observation_space.n
n_actions = env.action_space.n
```

This assures both you and the type checker that `.n` is available.

---

### **Option 3: Inform the Linter with Comments or Type Hints**

Sometimes, you can hint at the types to your IDE/linter:

```python
from gymnasium.spaces import Discrete

obs_space: Discrete = env.observation_space  # type: ignore
act_space: Discrete = env.action_space       # type: ignore
n_states = obs_space.n
n_actions = act_space.n
```

---

## Best Practice for RL Tutorials

- If you know your environment uses `Discrete` spaces, use **Option 1** (the `# type: ignore` comment) for conciseness and clarity.
- For production, add a runtime check or assertion so you get a clear error if you ever swap in a non-discrete env.

---

## TL;DR

The **type checker error** is just a limitation in its static analysis—not a bug in your code.  
Use:

```python
n_states = env.observation_space.n  # type: ignore
n_actions = env.action_space.n      # type: ignore
```
or add an explicit `assert isinstance(env.observation_space, Discrete)` first.

Let me know if you want a code snippet showing both the assert and the type ignore together!
