### Elementary Probability Theory Concepts and Theorems

These foundational concepts are critical for understanding probability and are
straightforward to implement in Python. They form the building blocks for
machine learning algorithms like Bayesian methods and probabilistic models.

- [ ] **Basic Probability Rules (Axioms of Probability)**

  - **Description**: The foundation of probability, including rules like the sum
    of probabilities equaling 1, non-negativity, and the addition rule for
    mutually exclusive events (P(A ∪ B) = P(A) + P(B)).
  - **Python Application**: Simulate coin flips or dice rolls to compute
    empirical probabilities. Use PyTorch to generate random samples and
    Matplotlib to visualize probability distributions.
  - **Example**: Compute the probability of getting heads in a coin flip by
    simulating 10,000 flips using `torch.rand`.

- [ ] **Conditional Probability**

  - **Description**: The probability of an event A given that event B has
    occurred, defined as P(A|B) = P(A ∩ B) / P(B), where P(B) > 0.
  - **Python Application**: Simulate a scenario like drawing cards from a deck
    to calculate conditional probabilities (e.g., probability of drawing an ace
    given the card is a spade). Use NumPy for data manipulation and PyTorch for
    tensor-based probability calculations.
  - **Example**: Program a card-drawing simulation and compute P(Ace|Spade).

- [ ] **Bayes’ Theorem**

  - **Description**: Relates conditional probabilities: P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)]
    / P(B). Fundamental for Bayesian inference in machine learning.
  - **Python Application**: Implement a spam email classifier using Bayes’
    theorem. Use PyTorch tensors to compute probabilities and SciPy for
    statistical functions. Visualize results with Matplotlib.
  - **Example**: Code a simple Bayesian classifier for spam vs. non-spam emails
    based on word frequencies.

- [ ] **Law of Total Probability**

  - **Description**: For a partition of the sample space {B₁, B₂, ..., Bₙ}, the
    probability of event A is P(A) = Σ P(A|Bᵢ) \* P(Bᵢ).
  - **Python Application**: Model a medical diagnosis scenario where you compute
    the total probability of a disease given test results. Use PyTorch for
    tensor operations and SciPy for probability distributions.
  - **Example**: Simulate a diagnostic test with false positives/negatives and
    compute P(Disease).

- [ ] **Independence of Events**

  - **Description**: Two events A and B are independent if P(A ∩ B) = P(A) \*
    P(B).
  - **Python Application**: Simulate independent events like rolling two dice
    and verify independence by comparing joint and product probabilities. Use
    PyTorch’s random number generation.
  - **Example**: Code a dice-rolling experiment to test independence of
    outcomes.

- [ ] **Random Variables and Probability Distributions**

  - **Description**: A random variable maps outcomes to numbers, with discrete
    (e.g., binomial) or continuous (e.g., normal) distributions. Key
    distributions include Bernoulli, Binomial, Poisson, Uniform, and Normal.
  - **Python Application**: Generate samples from these distributions using
    PyTorch’s `torch.distributions` module and visualize them with Matplotlib.
    Compute probabilities using SciPy.
  - **Example**: Simulate a binomial distribution (e.g., number of successes in
    n trials) and plot the probability mass function.

- [ ] **Expected Value and Variance**
  - **Description**: Expected value E(X) is the average outcome of a random
    variable, and variance Var(X) = E[(X - E(X))²] measures spread.
  - **Python Application**: Compute expected value and variance for a dataset
    (e.g., simulated stock returns). Use PyTorch tensors for calculations and
    NumPy for data handling.
  - **Example**: Calculate E(X) and Var(X) for a simulated dataset of dice
    rolls.

### Advanced Probability Theory Concepts and Theorems

These concepts build on the basics and are particularly relevant for machine
learning tasks like probabilistic graphical models, deep generative models, and
uncertainty quantification. They require a deeper understanding but can still be
implemented in Python.

- [ ] **Central Limit Theorem (CLT)**

  - **Description**: The sum (or average) of many independent random variables,
    under certain conditions, tends to a normal distribution, regardless of the
    underlying distribution.
  - **Python Application**: Simulate the CLT by summing samples from non-normal
    distributions (e.g., uniform) and plotting the resulting distribution. Use
    PyTorch for sampling and Matplotlib for visualization.
  - **Example**: Generate 1,000 sums of 50 uniform random variables and show the
    histogram converging to a normal distribution.

- [ ] **Law of Large Numbers (LLN)**

  - **Description**: As the sample size increases, the sample mean converges to
    the expected value.
  - **Python Application**: Simulate coin flips and plot the running average of
    heads to demonstrate convergence. Use PyTorch for random sampling and
    Matplotlib for plotting.
  - **Example**: Code a simulation showing the sample mean of Bernoulli trials
    converging to 0.5.

- [ ] **Moment-Generating Functions (MGFs)**

  - **Description**: The MGF of a random variable X is M(t) = E[e^(tX)], used to
    characterize distributions and derive moments.
  - **Python Application**: Compute the MGF for simple distributions (e.g.,
    exponential) and use it to find moments. Use SciPy for analytical
    distributions and PyTorch for numerical approximations.
  - **Example**: Numerically compute the MGF of an exponential distribution and
    verify its moments.

- [ ] **Markov’s and Chebyshev’s Inequalities**

  - **Description**: Provide bounds on probabilities. Markov’s: P(X ≥ a) ≤
    E(X)/a for non-negative X. Chebyshev’s: P(|X - E(X)| ≥ a) ≤ Var(X)/a².
  - **Python Application**: Simulate a dataset and compute these bounds to
    estimate tail probabilities. Use PyTorch for data generation and NumPy for
    calculations.
  - **Example**: Apply Chebyshev’s inequality to bound the probability of large
    deviations in a simulated dataset.

- [ ] **Multivariate Distributions and Covariance**

  - **Description**: Joint distributions of multiple random variables, with
    covariance measuring their linear relationship. Key example: multivariate
    normal distribution.
  - **Python Application**: Simulate a multivariate normal distribution using
    PyTorch’s `torch.distributions.MultivariateNormal` and visualize scatter
    plots with Matplotlib. Compute covariance matrices with NumPy.
  - **Example**: Generate samples from a 2D normal distribution and plot the
    covariance ellipse.

- [ ] **Convergence Concepts (e.g., Convergence in Probability, Almost Sure
      Convergence)**

  - **Description**: Formalizes how random variables behave as sample size
    grows, crucial for understanding statistical estimators in machine learning.
  - **Python Application**: Simulate convergence in probability by showing that
    a sequence of sample means approaches the true mean. Use PyTorch for
    simulations.
  - **Example**: Demonstrate convergence in probability for a sequence of
    binomial proportions.

- [ ] **Information Theory Concepts (Entropy, KL Divergence)**
  - **Description**: Entropy measures uncertainty in a distribution, and KL
    divergence quantifies the difference between two distributions. Critical for
    machine learning (e.g., variational inference).
  - **Python Application**: Compute entropy and KL divergence for discrete or
    continuous distributions using PyTorch’s `torch.distributions`. Visualize
    distributions with Matplotlib.
  - **Example**: Calculate the KL divergence between two normal distributions
    parameterized by PyTorch tensors.

### Programming Strategy for Learning

To effectively learn these concepts by programming, follow these steps for each
theorem or concept:

1. **Understand the Theory**: Read a brief explanation (e.g., from a textbook
   like _Introduction to Probability_ by Blitzstein and Hwang) and ensure you
   grasp the mathematical definition.
2. **Design a Scenario**: Create a realistic scenario (e.g., spam detection for
   Bayes’ theorem, stock returns for expected value) that applies the concept.
3. **Implement in Python**:
   - Use **PyTorch** for tensor operations, random sampling (`torch.rand`,
     `torch.distributions`), and probability calculations. PyTorch’s
     `distributions` module is ideal for distributions like Normal, Binomial, or
     MultivariateNormal.
   - Use **NumPy** for data manipulation and matrix operations (e.g., covariance
     matrices).
   - Use **SciPy** for statistical functions (e.g., `scipy.stats` for analytical
     distributions).
   - Use **Matplotlib** to visualize distributions, convergence, or scatter
     plots.
4. **Validate Results**: Compare your computed probabilities or statistics to
   theoretical values or SciPy’s implementations.
5. **Extend to Machine Learning**: Relate the concept to a machine learning task
   (e.g., Bayes’ theorem to naive Bayes, KL divergence to variational
   autoencoders).

### Example Python Program (Bayes’ Theorem with PyTorch)

Here’s a simple example to get you started, implementing Bayes’ theorem for a
spam email classifier:

```python
import torch
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Scenario: P(Spam) = 0.4, P(Word|Spam) = 0.7, P(Word|Not Spam) = 0.2
p_spam = torch.tensor(0.4)  # P(Spam)
p_not_spam = 1 - p_spam     # P(Not Spam)
p_word_given_spam = torch.tensor(0.7)  # P(Word|Spam)
p_word_given_not_spam = torch.tensor(0.2)  # P(Word|Not Spam)

# Law of Total Probability: P(Word) = P(Word|Spam)P(Spam) + P(Word|Not Spam)P(Not Spam)
p_word = p_word_given_spam * p_spam + p_word_given_not_spam * p_not_spam

# Bayes' Theorem: P(Spam|Word) = P(Word|Spam)P(Spam) / P(Word)
p_spam_given_word = (p_word_given_spam * p_spam) / p_word

print(f"P(Spam|Word) = {p_spam_given_word.item():.3f}")

# Visualize probabilities
labels = ['P(Spam)', 'P(Not Spam)', 'P(Word|Spam)', 'P(Word|Not Spam)', 'P(Spam|Word)']
values = [p_spam.item(), p_not_spam.item(), p_word_given_spam.item(), p_word_given_not_spam.item(), p_spam_given_word.item()]
plt.bar(labels, values)
plt.title("Probabilities in Spam Classifier")
plt.show()
```

This code uses PyTorch for calculations and Matplotlib for visualization. You
can extend it by simulating email data or incorporating more words.

  Binomial, Normal, and Poisson distributions. Plot their PDFs/PMFs with
  Matplotlib.
